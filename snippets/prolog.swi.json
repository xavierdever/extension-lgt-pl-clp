Options is a list of options that let you exhibit some  control over the search process. Several categories of options exist:  The variable selection strategy lets you specify which variable of Vars is labeled next and is one of: \n\nleftmost: Label the variables in the order they occur in Vars. This is  the default.\n\nff: First fail. Label the leftmost variable with smallest domain  next, in order to detect infeasibility early.

An algebraic data type is  defined using chr_type/1:  \n\n:- chr_type type ---> body.\n\n  If the type term is a functor of arity zero (i.e. one having zero  arguments), it names a monomorphic type. Otherwise, it names a  polymorphic type; the arguments of the functor must be distinct type  variables. The body term is defined as a sequence of constructor  definitions separated by semi-colons. \n\nEach constructor definition must be a functor whose arguments (if  any) are types. Discriminated union definitions must be transparent: all  type variables occurring in the body must also occur in the type. \n\nHere are some examples of algebraic data type definitions: \n\n\n\n:- chr_type color ---> red ; blue ; yellow ; green.\n\n:- chr_type tree --->  empty ; leaf(int) ; branch(tree, tree).\n\n:- chr_type list(T) ---> [] ; [T | list(T)].\n\n:- chr_type pair(T1, T2) ---> (T1 - T2).\n\n  Each algebraic data type definition introduces a distinct type.

This means that arbitrary goals can only be called  from a directive by means of the initialization/1  directive.

Such programs should fail, but sometimes succeed  because the constraint solver is too weak to detect the contradiction.  Ideally, delayed goals and constraints are all executed at the end of  the computation. The meta predicate call_residue_vars/2  finds variables that are given attributes or whose attributes are  modified by Goal, regardless of whether or not these  variables are reachable from the arguments of Goal.146The  implementation of call_residue_vars/2  is completely redone in version 7.3.2 (7.2.1) after discussion with Bart  Demoen.

Also, repeat/0  is not implemented as below, but as a non-deterministic foreign  predicate. \n\n\n\nrepeat.\nrepeat :-\n        repeat.\n\n  As a result, call_with_depth_limit/3  may still loop infinitely on programs that should theoretically finish  in finite time.

After termination of Goal, Result is unified with the atom inference_limit_exceeded.

Default is 1.\n\n  For example, given the following predicate that relates three tasks  of durations 2 and 3 to a list containing their starting times: \n\n\n\ntasks_starts(Tasks, [S1,S2,S3]) :-\n        Tasks = [task(S1,3,_,1,_),\n                 task(S2,2,_,1,_),\n                 task(S3,2,_,1,_)].\n\n  We can use cumulative/2  as follows, and obtain a schedule: \n\n\n\n?- tasks_starts(Tasks, Starts), Starts ins 0..10,\n   cumulative(Tasks, [limit(2)]), label(Starts).\nTasks = [task(0, 3, 3, 1, _G36), task(0, 2, 2, 1, _G45), ...],\nStarts = [0, 0, 2] .\n\n ",

Labeling means  systematically trying out values for the finite domain variables Vars  until all of them are ground. The domain of each variable in Vars  must be finite. Options is a list of options that let you exhibit some  control over the search process. Several categories of options exist:  The variable selection strategy lets you specify which variable of Vars is labeled next and is one of: \n\nleftmost: Label the variables in the order they occur in Vars. This is  the default.\n\nff: First fail. Label the leftmost variable with smallest domain  next, in order to detect infeasibility early. This is often a good  strategy.\n\nffc: Of the variables with smallest domains, the leftmost one participating  in most constraints is labeled next.\n\nmin: Label the leftmost variable whose lower bound is the lowest next.\n\nmax: Label the leftmost variable whose upper bound is the highest next.\n\n  The value order is one of: \n\nup: Try the elements of the chosen variable's domain in ascending order.  This is the default.\n\ndown: Try the domain elements in descending order.\n\n  The branching strategy is one of: \n\nstep: For each variable X, a choice is made between X = V and X #\\=  V, where V is determined by the value ordering options. This is the  default.\n\nenum: For each variable X, a choice is made between X = V_1, X = V_2 etc., for  all values V_i of the domain of X. The order is determined by the value  ordering options.\n\nbisect: For each variable X, a choice is made between X #=< M  and X #> M, where M is the midpoint of the domain of X.\n\n  At most one option of each category can be specified, and an option  must not occur repeatedly. \n\nThe order of solutions can be influenced with: \n\n\n\nmin(Expr)\nmax(Expr)\n\n  This generates solutions in ascending/descending order with respect  to the evaluation of the arithmetic expression Expr. Labeling Vars  must make Expr ground. If several such options are specified, they are  interpreted from left to right, e.g.: \n\n\n\n?- [X,Y] ins 10..20, labeling([max(X),min(Y)],[X,Y]).\n\n  This generates solutions in descending order of X, and for each  binding of X, solutions are generated in ascending order of Y.

    "description":"[ISO]current_prolog_flag(?Key, -Value).\nThe predicate current_prolog_flag/2  defines an interface to installation features: options compiled in,  version, home, etc. With both arguments unbound, it will generate all  defined Prolog flags. With Key instantiated, it unifies Value  with the value of the Prolog flag or fails if the Key is not  a Prolog flag.  Flags marked rw can be modified by the user using set_prolog_flag/2.  Flag values are typed. Flags marked as bool can have the  values true or false. The predicate create_prolog_flag/3  may be used to create flags that describe or control behaviour of  libraries and applications. The library library(settings) provides an alternative interface for  managing notably application parameters. \n\nSome Prolog flags are not defined in all versions, which is normally  indicated in the documentation below as ``if present and true''.  A boolean Prolog flag is true iff the Prolog flag is present and the Value is the atom true. Tests for  such flags should be written as below: \n\n\n\n        (   current_prolog_flag(windows, true)\n        ->  <Do MS-Windows things>\n        ;   <Do normal things>\n        )\n\n  Some Prolog flags are scoped to a source file. This implies that if  they are set using a directive inside a file, the flag value encountered  when loading of the file started is restored when loading of the file is  completed. Currently, the following flags are scoped to the source file: generate_debug_info  and optimise. \n\nA new thread (see section 9) copies  all flags from the thread that created the new thread (its parent).15This  is implemented using the copy-on-write tecnhnique. As a  consequence, modifying a flag inside a thread does not affect other  threads. \n\naccess_level(atom, changeable): This flag defines a normal `user' view (user, default) or a  `system' view. In system view all system code is fully accessible as if  it was normal user code. In user view, certain operations are not  permitted and some details are kept invisible. We leave the exact  consequences undefined, but, for example, system code can be traced  using system access and system predicates can be redefined.\n\naddress_bits(integer): Address size of the hosting machine. Typically 32 or 64. Except for the  maximum stack limit, this has few implications to the user. See also the  Prolog flag arch.\n\nagc_margin(integer, changeable): If this amount of atoms possible garbage atoms exist perform atom  garbage collection at the first opportunity. Initial value is 10,000.  May be changed. A value of 0 (zero) disables atom garbage collection.  See also PL_register_atom().16Given  that SWI-Prolog has no limit on the length of atoms, 10,000 atoms may  still occupy a lot of memory. Applications using extremely large atoms  may wish to call garbage_collect_atoms/0  explicitly or lower the margin.\n\napple(bool): If present and true, the  operating system is MacOSX. Defined if the C compiler used to compile  this version of SWI-Prolog defines __APPLE__. Note that the unix  is also defined for MacOSX.\n\nallow_dot_in_atom(bool, changeable): If true (default false), dots may be embedded  into atoms that are not quoted and start with a letter. The embedded dot must be followed by an identifier continuation character (i.e.,  letter, digit or underscore). The dot is allowed in identifiers in many  languages, which can make this a useful flag for defining DSLs. Note  that this conflicts with cascading functional notation. For example, Post.meta.author is read as .(Post, 'meta.author'  if this flag is set to true.\n\nallow_variable_name_as_functor(bool, changeable): If true (default is false), Functor(arg) is read as if it  were written 'Functor'(arg). Some applications use the  Prolog read/1  predicate for reading an application-defined script language. In these  cases, it is often difficult to explain to non-Prolog users of the  application that constants and functions can only start with a lowercase  letter. Variables can be turned into atoms starting with an uppercase  atom by calling read_term/2  using the option variable_names and binding the variables  to their name. Using this feature, F(x) can be turned into valid syntax  for such script languages. Suggested by Robert van Engelen. SWI-Prolog  specific.\n\nargv(list, changeable): List is a list of atoms representing the application command line  arguments. Application command line arguments are those that have not been processed by Prolog during its initialization. Note  that Prolog's argument processing stops at -- or the first  non-option argument. See also os_argv.17Prior  to version 6.5.2, argv  was defined as os_argv  is now. The change was made for compatibility reasone and because the  current definition is more practical.\n\narch(atom): Identifier for the hardware and operating system SWI-Prolog is running  on. Used to select foreign files for the right architecture. See also section 11.2.3 and file_search_path/2.\n\nassociated_file(atom): Set if Prolog was started with a prolog file as argument. Used by e.g., edit/0  to edit the initial file.\n\nautoload(bool, changeable): If true (default) autoloading of library functions is  enabled.\n\nback_quotes(codes,chars,string,symbol_char, changeable): Defines the term-representation for back-quoted material. The default is codes.  If --traditional is given, the default is symbol_char,  which allows using ` in operators composed of symbols.18Older  versions had a boolean flag backquoted_strings, which  toggled between string and symbol_char.  See also section 5.2.\n\nbacktrace(bool, changeable): If true (default), print a backtrace on an uncaught  exception.\n\nbacktrace_depth(integer, changeable): If backtraces on errors are enabled, this flag defines the maximum  number of frames that is printed (default 20).\n\nbacktrace_goal_depth(integer, changeable): The frame of a backtrace is printed after making a shallow copy of the  goal. This flag determines the depth to which the goal term is copied.  Default is `3'.\n\nbacktrace_show_lines(bool, changeable): If true (default), try to reconstruct the line number at  which the exception happened.\n\nbounded(bool): ISO Prolog flag. If true, integer representation is bound  by min_integer and max_integer.  If false integers can be arbitrarily large and the min_integer  and max_integer are  not present. See section 4.27.2.1.\n\nbreak_level(integer): Current break-level. The initial top level (started with -t) has value 0. See break/0.  This flag is absent from threads that are not running a top-level loop.\n\nc_cc(atom, changeable): Name of the C compiler used to compile SWI-Prolog. Normally either gcc  or cc. See section 11.5.\n\nc_cflags(atom, changeable): CFLAGS used to compile SWI-Prolog. See section  11.5.\n\nc_ldflags(atom, changeable): LDFLAGS used to link SWI-Prolog. See section  11.5.\n\nc_libs(atom, changeable): Libraries needed to link executables that embed SWI-Prolog. Typically -lswipl if the SWI-Prolog kernel is a shared (DLL). If the  SWI-Prolog kernel is in a static library, this flag also contains the  dependencies.\n\nc_libplso(atom, changeable): Libraries needed to link extensions (shared object, DLL) to SWI-Prolog.  Typically empty on ELF systems and -lswipl on COFF-based  systems. See section 11.5.\n\nchar_conversion(bool, changeable): Determines whether character conversion takes place while reading terms.  See also char_conversion/2.\n\ncharacter_escapes(bool, changeable): If true (default), read/1  interprets \\ escape sequences in quoted atoms and strings.  May be changed. This flag is local to the module in which it is changed.  See section 2.15.1.3.\n\ncolon_sets_calling_context(bool, changeable): Using the construct <module>:<goal>  sets the calling context for executing <goal>.  This flag is defined by ISO/IEC 13211-2 (Prolog modules standard). See section  6.\n\ncolor_term(bool, changeable): This flag is managed by library library(ansi_term), which  is loaded at startup if the two conditions below are both true. Note  that this implies that setting this flag to false from the  system or personal initialization file (see section  2.2 disables colored output. The predicate message_property/2  can be used to control the actual color scheme depending in the message  type passed to print_message/2.  stream_property(current_output, tty(true))\n\\+ current_prolog_flag(color_term, false)\n\n\n\ncompile_meta_arguments(atom, changeable): Experimental flag that controls compilation of arguments passed to  meta-calls marked `0' or `^' (see meta_predicate/1).  Supported values are:  false(default). Meta-arguments are passed verbatim.controlCompile meta-arguments that contain control structures ((A,B), (A;B),  (A->B;C), etc.). If not compiled at compile time, such arguments are  compiled to a temporary clause before execution. Using this option  enhances performance of processing complex meta-goals that are known at  compile time.trueAlso compile references to normal user predicates. This harms  performance (a little), but enhances the power of poor-mens consistency  check used by make/0  and implemented by list_undefined/0.alwaysAlways create an intermediate clause, even for system predicates. This  prepares for replacing the normal head of the generated predicate with a  special reference (similar to database references as used by, e.g., assert/2)  that provides direct access to the executable code, thus avoiding  runtime lookup of predicates for meta-calling. \n\ncompiled_at(atom): Describes when the system has been compiled. Only available if the C  compiler used to compile SWI-Prolog provides the __DATE__ and __TIME__  macros.\n\nconsole_menu(bool): Set to true in swipl-win.exe to indicate that the  console supports menus. See also section  4.35.3.\n\ncpu_count(integer, changeable): Number of physical CPUs or cores in the system. The flag is marked  read-write both to allow pretending the system has more or less  processors. See also thread_setconcurrency/2  and the library library(thread). This flag is not available on systems  where we do not know how to get the number of CPUs. This flag is not  included in a saved state (see qsave_program/1).\n\ndde(bool): Set to true if this instance of Prolog supports DDE as  described in section 4.43.\n\ndebug(bool, changeable): Switch debugging mode on/off. If debug mode is activated the system  traps encountered spy points (see spy/1)  and trace points (see trace/1).  In addition, last-call optimisation is disabled and the system is more  conservative in destroying choice points to simplify debugging.  Disabling these optimisations can cause the system to run out of  memory on programs that behave correctly if debug mode is off.\n\ndebug_on_error(bool, changeable): If true, start the tracer after an error is detected.  Otherwise just continue execution. The goal that raised the error will  normally fail. See also the Prolog flag report_error.  Default is true.\n\ndebugger_write_options(term, changeable): This argument is given as option-list to write_term/2  for printing goals by the debugger. Modified by the `w', `p' and `<N>  d' commands of the debugger. Default is [quoted(true),  portray(true), max_depth(10), attributes(portray)].\n\ndebugger_show_context(bool, changeable): If true, show the context module while printing a  stack-frame in the tracer. Normally controlled using the `C' option of  the tracer.\n\ndialect(atom): Fixed to swi. The code below is a reliable and portable way  to detect SWI-Prolog.  \n\nis_dialect(swi) :-\n        catch(current_prolog_flag(dialect, swi), _, fail).\n\n \n\ndouble_quotes(codes,chars,atom,string, changeable): This flag determines how double quoted strings are read by Prolog and is  ---like character_escapes  and back_quotes---  maintained for each module. The default is string, which  produces a string as described in section  5.2. If --traditional is given, the default is codes,  which produces a list of character codes, integers that represent a  Unicode code-point. The value chars produces a list of  one-character atoms and the value atom makes double quotes  the same as single quotes, creating a atom. See also section  5.\n\neditor(atom, changeable): Determines the editor used by edit/1.  See section 4.4.1 for details on  selecting the editor used.\n\nemacs_inferior_process(bool): If true, SWI-Prolog is running as an inferior process of  (GNU/X-)Emacs. SWI-Prolog assumes this is the case if the environment  variable EMACS is t and INFERIOR  is yes.\n\nencoding(atom, changeable): Default encoding used for opening files in text mode. The  initial value is deduced from the environment. See section  2.18.1 for details.\n\nexecutable(atom): Pathname of the running executable. Used by qsave_program/2  as default emulator.\n\nexit_status(integer): Set by halt/1  to its argument, making the exit status available to hooks registered  with at_halt/1.\n\nfile_name_case_handling(atom, changeable): This flag defines how Prolog handles the case of file names. The flag is  used for case normalization and to determine whether two names refer to  the same file.bugNote that file  name case handling is typically a properly of the filesystem, while  Prolog only has a global flag to determine its file handling.  It has one of the following values:  case_sensitiveThe filesystem is fully case sensitive. Prolog does not perform any case  modification or case insensitive matching. This is the default on Unix  systems.case_preservingThe filesystem is case insensitive, but it preserves the case with which  the user jas created a file. This is the default on Windows systems.case_insensitiveThe filesystem doesn't store or match case. In this scenario Prolog maps  all file names to lower case. \n\nfile_name_variables(bool, changeable): If true (default false), expand $varname  and ~ in arguments of built-in predicates that  accept a file name (open/3, exists_file/1, access_file/2,  etc.). The predicate expand_file_name/2  can be used to expand environment variables and wildcard patterns. This  Prolog flag is intended for backward compatibility with older versions  of SWI-Prolog.\n\nfile_search_cache_time(number, changeable): Time in seconds for which search results from absolute_file_name/3  are cached. Within this time limit, the system will first check that the  old search result satisfies the conditions. Default is 10 seconds, which  typically avoids most repetitive searches for (library) files during  compilation. Setting this value to 0 (zero) disables the cache.\n\ngc(bool, changeable): If true (default), the garbage collector is active. If false, neither  garbage collection, nor stack shifts will take place, even not on  explicit request. May be changed.\n\ngenerate_debug_info(bool, changeable): If true (default) generate code that can be debugged using trace/0, spy/1,  etc. Can be set to false using the -nodebug. This flag is scoped within a source file.  Many of the libraries have :- set_prolog_flag(generate_debug_info, false) to hide  their details from a normal trace.19In  the current implementation this only causes a flag to be set on the  predicate that causes children to be hidden from the debugger. The name  anticipates further changes to the compiler.\n\ngmp_version(integer): If Prolog is linked with GMP, this flag gives the major version of the  GMP library used. See also section  11.4.8.\n\ngui(bool): Set to true if XPCE is around and can be used for graphics.\n\nhistory(integer, changeable): If integer> 0, support Unix csh(1)-like  history as described in section 2.7.  Otherwise, only support reusing commands through the command line  editor. The default is to set this Prolog flag to 0 if a command line  editor is provided (see Prolog flag readline) and 15  otherwise.\n\nhome(atom): SWI-Prolog's notion of the home directory. SWI-Prolog uses its home  directory to find its startup file as <home>/boot32.prc (32-bit machines) or <home>/boot64.prc (64-bit machines) and to  find its library as <home>/library.\n\nhwnd(integer): In swipl-win.exe, this refers to the MS-Windows window handle of  the console window.\n\ninteger_rounding_function(down,toward_zero): ISO Prolog flag describing rounding by // and rem  arithmetic functions. Value depends on the C compiler used.\n\niso(bool, changeable): Include some weird ISO compatibility that is incompatible with normal  SWI-Prolog behaviour. Currently it has the following effect: The //2 (float division) always  returns a float, even if applied to integers that can be divided.\nIn the standard order of terms (see section  4.7.1), all floats are before all integers.\natom_length/2  yields a type error if the first argument is a number.\nclause/[2,3]  raises a permission error when accessing static predicates.\nabolish/[1,2]  raises a permission error when accessing static predicates.\nSyntax is closer to the ISO standard: Unquoted commas and bars appearing as atoms are not allowed. Instead  of f(,,a) now write f(',',a). Unquoted commas can  only be used to separate arguments in functional notation and list  notation, and as a conjunction operator. Unquoted bars can only appear  within lists to separate head and tail, like [Head|Tail],  and as infix operator for alternation in grammar rules, like a -->  b | c.Within functional notation and list notation terms must have  priority below 1000. That means that rules and control constructs  appearing as arguments need bracketing. A term like [a :- b, c].  must now be disambiguated to mean [(a :- b), c]. or [(a  :- b, c)].Operators appearing as operands must be bracketed. Instead of X  == -, true. write X == (-), true. Currently, this is  not entirely enforced.Backslash-escaped newlines are interpreted according to the ISO  standard. See section 2.15.1.3.\n\n\n\nlarge_files(bool): If present and true, SWI-Prolog has been compiled with large file support (LFS) and is capable of accessing files  larger than 2GB on 32-bit hardware. Large file support is default on  installations built using configure that support it and may be  switched off using the configure option --disable-largefile.\n\nlast_call_optimisation(bool, changeable): Determines whether or not last-call optimisation is enabled. Normally  the value of this flag is the negation of the debug  flag. As programs may run out of stack if last-call optimisation is  omitted, it is sometimes necessary to enable it during debugging.\n\nmax_arity(unbounded): ISO Prolog flag describing there is no maximum arity to compound terms.\n\nmax_integer(integer): Maximum integer value if integers are bounded. See also the  flag bounded and section  4.27.2.1.\n\nmax_tagged_integer(integer): Maximum integer value represented as a `tagged' value. Tagged integers  require one word storage. Larger integers are represented as `indirect  data' and require significantly more space.\n\nmin_integer(integer): Minimum integer value if integers are bounded. See also the  flag bounded and section  4.27.2.1.\n\nmin_tagged_integer(integer): Start of the tagged-integer value range.\n\noccurs_check(atom, changeable): This flag controls unification that creates an infinite tree (also  called cyclic term) and can have three values. Using false (default), unification succeeds, creating an infinite  tree. Using true, unification behaves as unify_with_occurs_check/2,  failing silently. Using error, an attempt to create a  cyclic term results in an occurs_check exception. The  latter is intended for debugging unintentional creations of cyclic  terms. Note that this flag is a global flag modifying fundamental  behaviour of Prolog. Changing the flag from its default may cause  libraries to stop functioning properly.\n\nopen_shared_object(bool): If true, open_shared_object/2  and friends are implemented, providing access to shared libraries (.so  files) or dynamic link libraries (.DLL files).\n\noptimise(bool, changeable): If true, compile in optimised mode. The initial value is true if Prolog was started with the -O  command line option. The optimise  flag is scoped to a source file.  Currently optimised compilation implies compilation of arithmetic,  and deletion of redundant true/0  that may result from expand_goal/2. Later versions might imply various other optimisations such as  integrating small predicates into their callers, eliminating constant  expressions and other predictable constructs. Source code optimisation  is never applied to predicates that are declared dynamic (see dynamic/1).\n\nos_argv(list, changeable): List is a list of atoms representing the command line arguments used to  invoke SWI-Prolog. Please note that all arguments are included in  the list returned. See argv  to get the application options.\n\npid(int): Process identifier of the running Prolog process. Existence of this flag  is implementation-defined.\n\npipe(bool, changeable): If true, open(pipe(command), mode, Stream), etc. are  supported. Can be changed to disable the use of pipes in applications  testing this feature. Not recommended.\n\nprint_write_options(term, changeable): Specifies the options for write_term/2  used by print/1  and print/2.\n\nprompt_alternatives_on(atom, changeable): Determines prompting for  alternatives in the Prolog top level. Default is determinism, which implies the system prompts for  alternatives if the goal succeeded while leaving choice points. Many  classical Prolog systems behave as groundness: they prompt  for alternatives if and only if the query contains variables.\n\nprotect_static_code(bool, changeable): If true (default false), clause/2  does not operate on static code, providing some basic protection from  hackers that wish to list the static code of your Prolog program. Once  the flag is true, it cannot be changed back to false.  Protection is default in ISO mode (see Prolog flag iso).  Note that many parts of the development environment require clause/2  to work on static code, and enabling this flag should thus only be used  for production code.\n\nqcompile(atom, changeable): This option provides the default for the qcompile(+Atom)  option of load_files/2.\n\nreadline(atom, changeable): Specifies which form of command line editing is provided. Possible  values are below. The flag may be set from the user's init file (see section 2.3) to one of false, readline  or editline. This causes the toplevel not to load a command  line editor (false) or load the specified one. If loading  fails the flag is set to false.  falseNo command line editing is available.readlineThe library library(readline) is loaded, providing line  editing based on the GNU readline library.editlineThe library library(editline) is loaded, providing line  editing based on the BSD libedit. This is the default if library(editline)  is available and can be loaded.swipl_winSWI-Prolog uses its own console (swipl-win.exe on Windows, the Qt  based swipl-win on MacOS) which provides line editing. \n\nresource_database(atom): Set to the absolute filename of the attached state. Typically this is  the file boot32.prc, the file specified with -x  or the running executable. See also resource/3.\n\nreport_error(bool, changeable): If true, print error messages; otherwise suppress them. May  be changed. See also the debug_on_error  Prolog flag. Default is true, except for the runtime  version.\n\nruntime(bool): If present and true, SWI-Prolog is compiled with  -DO_RUNTIME, disabling various useful development features (currently  the tracer and profiler).\n\nsandboxed_load(bool, changeable): If true (default false), load_files/2  calls hooks to allow library(sandbox) to verify the safety of  directives.\n\nsaved_program(bool): If present and true, Prolog has been started from a state  saved with qsave_program/[1,2].\n\nshared_object_extension(atom): Extension used by the operating system for shared objects. .so  for most Unix systems and .dll for Windows. Used for  locating files using the file_type executable.  See also absolute_file_name/3.\n\nshared_object_search_path(atom): Name of the environment variable used by the system to search for shared  objects.\n\nsignals(bool): Determine whether Prolog is handling signals (software interrupts). This  flag is false if the hosting OS does not support signal  handling or the command line option -nosignals is  active. See section 11.4.21.1 for  details.\n\nstream_type_check(atom, changeable): Defines whether and how strictly the system validates that byte I/O  should not be applied to text streams and text I/O should not be applied  to binary streams. Values are false (no checking), true  (full checking) and loose. Using checking mode loose  (default), the system accepts byte I/O from text stream that use ISO  Latin-1 encoding and accepts writing text to binary streams.\n\nsystem_thread_id(int): Available in multithreaded version (see section  9) where the operating system provides system-wide integer thread  identifiers. The integer is the thread identifier used by the operating  system for the calling thread. See also thread_self/1.\n\ntable_space(integer, changeable): Space reserved for storing answer tables for tabled predicates  (see table/1).bugCurrently  only counts the space occupied by the nodes in the answer tries.  When exceeded a resource_error(table_space) exception is raised.\n\ntimezone(integer): Offset in seconds west of GMT of the current time zone. Set at  initialization time from the timezone variable associated  with the POSIX tzset() function. See also format_time/3.\n\ntoplevel_mode(atom, changeable): If backtracking (default), the toplevel backtracks after  completing a query. If recursive, the toplevel is  implemented as a recursive loop. This implies that global variables set  using b_setval/2  are maintained between queries. In recursive mode, answers to  toplevel variables (see section 2.8)  are kept in backtrackable global variables and thus not copied.  In backtracking mode answers to toplevel variables are kept in the  recorded database (see section 4.14.2).  The recursive mode has been added for interactive usage of CHR (see section 8),20Suggested  by Falco Nogatz which maintains the global constraint store  in backtrackable global variables.\n\ntoplevel_print_anon(bool, changeable): If true, top-level variables starting with an underscore (_)  are printed normally. If false they are hidden. This may be  used to hide bindings in complex queries from the top level.\n\ntoplevel_print_factorized(bool, changeable): If true (default false) show the internal  sharing of subterms in the answer substitution. The example below  reveals internal sharing of leaf nodes in red-black trees as  implemented by the library(rbtrees) predicate rb_new1:  \n\n?- set_prolog_flag(toplevel_print_factorized, true).\n?- rb_new(X).\nX = t(_S1, _S1), % where\n    _S1 = black('', _G387, _G388, '').\n\n  If this flag is false, the % where notation  is still used to indicate cycles as illustrated below. This example also  shows that the implementation reveals the internal cycle length, and not  the minimal cycle length. Cycles of different length are  indistinguishable in Prolog (as illustrated by S == R). \n\n?- S = s(S), R = s(s(R)), S == R.\nS = s(S),\nR = s(s(R)).\n\n \n\nanswer_write_options(term, changeable): This argument is given as option-list to write_term/2  for printing results of queries. Default is [quoted(true),  portray(true), max_depth(10), attributes(portray)].\n\ntoplevel_prompt(atom, changeable): Define the prompt that is used by the interactive top level. The  following ~ (tilde) sequences are replaced:  ~mType in  module if not user (see module/1) ~lBreak  level if not 0 (see break/0) ~dDebugging  state if not normal execution (see debug/0, trace/0) ~!History  event if history is enabled (see flag history) \n\ntoplevel_var_size(int, changeable): Maximum size counted in literals of a term returned as a binding for a  variable in a top-level query that is saved for re-use using the $ variable reference. See section  2.8.\n\ntrace_gc(bool, changeable): If true (default false), garbage collections  and stack-shifts will be reported on the terminal. May be changed.  Values are reported in bytes as G+T, where G  is the global stack value and T the trail stack value.  `Gained' describes the number of bytes reclaimed. `used' the number of  bytes on the stack after GC and `free' the number of bytes allocated,  but not in use. Below is an example output.  \n\n% GC: gained 236,416+163,424 in 0.00 sec;\n      used 13,448+5,808; free 72,568+47,440\n\n \n\ntraditional(bool): Available in SWI-Prolog version 7. If true,  `traditional' mode has been selected using --traditional.  Notice that some SWI7 features, like the functional notation on dicts,  do not work in this mode. See also section  5.\n\ntty_control(bool, changeable): Determines whether the terminal is switched to raw mode for get_single_char/1,  which also reads the user actions for the trace. May be set. If this  flag is false at startup, command line editing is disabled.  See also the +/-tty command line option.\n\nunix(bool): If present and true, the  operating system is some version of Unix. Defined if the C compiler used  to compile this version of SWI-Prolog either defines __unix__  or unix. On other systems this flag is not available. See  also apple and windows.\n\nunknown(fail,warning,error, changeable): Determines the behaviour if an undefined procedure is encountered. If fail, the predicate fails silently. If warn, a  warning is printed, and execution continues as if the predicate was not  defined, and if error (default), an existence_error  exception is raised. This flag is local to each module and inherited  from the module's import-module. Using default setup, this  implies that normal modules inherit the flag from user,  which in turn inherit the value error from system.  The user may change the flag for module user to change the  default for all application modules or for a specific module. It is  strongly advised to keep the error default and use dynamic/1  and/or multifile/1  to specify possible non-existence of a predicate.\n\nunload_foreign_libraries(bool, changeable): If true (default false), unload all loaded  foreign libraries. Default is false because modern OSes  reclaim the resources anyway and unloading the foreign code may cause  registered hooks to point to no longer existing data or code.\n\nuser_flags(Atom, changeable): Define the behaviour of set_prolog_flag/2  if the flag is not known. Values are silent, warning  and error. The first two create the flag on-the-fly, where warning  prints a message. The value error is consistent with ISO:  it raises an existence error and does not create the flag. See also create_prolog_flag/3.  The default is silent, but future versions may change that.  Developers are encouraged to use another value and ensure proper use of create_prolog_flag/3  to create flags for their library.\n\nvar_prefix(bool, changeable): If true (default false), variables must start  with an underscore (_). May be changed. This flag is local  to the module in which it is changed. See section  2.15.1.7.\n\nverbose(atom, changeable): This flag is used by print_message/2.  If its value is silent, messages of type informational  and banner are suppressed. The -q switches  the value from the initial normal to silent.\n\nverbose_autoload(bool, changeable): If true the normal consult message will be printed if a  library is autoloaded. By default this message is suppressed. Intended  to be used for debugging purposes.\n\nverbose_load(atom, changeable): Determines messages printed for loading (compiling) Prolog files.  Current values are full (print a message at the start and  end of each file loaded), normal (print a message at the  end of each file loaded), brief (print a message at end of  loading the toplevel file), and silent (no messages are  printed, default). The value of this flag is normally controlled by the  option silent(Bool) provided by load_files/2.\n\nverbose_file_search(bool, changeable): If true (default false), print messages  indicating the progress of absolute_file_name/[2,3]  in locating files. Intended for debugging complicated file-search paths.  See also file_search_path/2.\n\nversion(integer): The version identifier is an integer with value:  10000 × Major + 100 × Minor  + Patch\n\nversion_data(swi(Major, Minor, Patch, Extra)): Part of the dialect compatibility layer; see also the Prolog flag dialect and section  C. Extra provides platform-specific version information  as a list. Extra is used for tagged versions such as ``7.4.0-rc1'', in which case Extra contains a term tag(rc1).\n\nversion_git(atom): Available if created from a git repository. See git-describe for  details.\n\nwarn_override_implicit_import(bool, changeable): If true (default), a warning is printed if an implicitly  imported predicate is clobbered by a local definition. See use_module/1  for details.\n\nwin_file_access_check(atom, changeable): Controls the behaviour or access_file/2  under Windows. There is no reliable way to check access to files and  directories on Windows. This flag allows for switching between three  alternative approximations.  accessUse Windows _waccess() function. This ignores ACLs (Access Control List)  and thus may indicate that access is allowed while it is not.filesecurityUse the Windows GetFileSecurity() function. This does not work on all  file systems, but is probably the best choice on file systems that do  support it, notably local NTFS volumes.opencloseTry to open the file and close it. This works reliable for files, but  not for directories. Currently directories are checked using _waccess().  This is the default. \n\nwindows(bool): If present and true, the  operating system is an implementation of Microsoft Windows. This flag is  only available on MS-Windows based versions. See also unix.\n\nwrite_attributes(atom, changeable): Defines how write/1  and friends write attributed variables. The option values are described  with the attributes option of write_term/3.  Default is ignore.\n\nwrite_help_with_overstrike(bool): Internal flag used by help/1  when writing to a terminal. If present and true it prints  bold and underlined text using overstrike.\n\nxpce(bool): Available and set to true if the XPCE graphics system is  loaded.\n\nxpce_version(atom): Available and set to the version of the loaded XPCE system.\n\nxref(bool, changeable): If true, source code is being read for analysis  purposes such as cross-referencing. Otherwise (default) it is being read  to be compiled. This flag is used at several places by term_expansion/2  and goal_expansion/2  hooks, notably if these hooks use side effects. See also the libraries library(prolog_source)  and library(prolog_xref).\n\n ",

This flexibility allows for  easy computation of the time at any given number of these units from a  given timestamp. Normalization can be achieved following this call with stamp_date_time/3.

Suppose an argument must be a non-negative integer. If the actual  argument is not an integer, this is a type_error. If it is a  negative integer, it is a domain_error. \n\nTypical borderline cases are predicates accepting a compound term,  e.g., point(X,Y). One could argue that the basic type is a  compound-term and any other compound term is a domain error. Most Prolog  programmers consider each compound as a type and would consider a  compoint that is not point(_,_) a type_error.\n\n",

    "description":"format(+Format, :Arguments).\nFormat is an atom, list of character codes, or a Prolog  string. Arguments provides the arguments required by the format  specification. If only one argument is required and this single argument  is not a list, the argument need not be put in a list. Otherwise the  arguments are put in a list.  Special sequences start with the tilde (~),  followed by an optional numeric argument, optionally followed by a colon  modifier (:), 121The colon modifiers is a  SWI-Prolog extension, proposed by Richard O'Keefe. followed  by a character describing the action to be undertaken. A numeric  argument is either a sequence of digits, representing a positive decimal  number, a sequence `<character>,  representing the character code value of the character (only useful for ~t) or a asterisk (*), in which  case the numeric argument is taken from the next argument of the  argument list, which should be a positive integer. E.g., the following  three examples all pass 46 (.) to ~t: \n\n\n\n?- format('~w ~46t ~w~72|~n', ['Title', 'Page']).\n?- format('~w ~`.t ~w~72|~n', ['Title', 'Page']).\n?- format('~w ~*t ~w~72|~n', ['Title', 46, 'Page']).\n\n  Numeric conversion (d, D, e, E, f, g  and G) accept an arithmetic expression as argument. This is  introduced to handle rational numbers transparently (see section 4.27.2.2). The floating  point conversions allow for unlimited precision for printing rational  numbers in decimal form. E.g., the following will write as many 3's as  you want by changing the `50'. \n\n\n\n?- format('~50f', [10 rdiv 3]).\n3.33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333\n\n  \n\n~ Output the tilde itself.  \na Output the next argument, which must be an atom. This option is  equivalent to w, except that it requires the argument to be an  atom.  \nc Interpret the next argument as a character code and add it to the  output. This argument must be a valid Unicode character code. Note that  the actually emitted bytes are defined by the character encoding of the  output stream and an exception may be raised if the output stream is not  capable of representing the requested Unicode character. See section 2.18.1 for details.  \nd Output next argument as a decimal number. It should be an integer. If a  numeric argument is specified, a dot is inserted argument  positions from the right (useful for doing fixed point arithmetic with  integers, such as handling amounts of money).  The colon modifier (e.g., ~:d) causes the number to be  printed according to the locale of the output stream. See section  4.23. \nD Same as d, but makes large values easier to read by inserting a  comma every three digits left or right of the dot. This is the same as ~:d,  but using the fixed English locale.  \ne Output next argument as a floating point number in exponential notation.  The numeric argument specifies the precision. Default is 6 digits. Exact  representation depends on the C library function printf(). This function  is invoked with the format %.<precision>e.  \nE Equivalent to e, but outputs a capital E to indicate the  exponent.  \nf Floating point in non-exponential notation. The numeric argument defines  the number of digits right of the decimal point. If the colon modifier  (:) is used, the float is formatted using conventions from the current  locale, which may define the decimal point as well as grouping of digits  left of the decimal point.  \ng Floating point in e or f notation, whichever is shorter.  \nG Floating point in E or f notation, whichever is shorter.  \ni Ignore next argument of the argument list. Produces no output.  \nI Emit a decimal number using Prolog digit grouping (the underscore, _). The argument describes the size of each digit group.  The default is 3. See also section  2.15.1.5. For example:  ?- A is 1<<100, format('~10I', [A]). 1_2676506002_2822940149_6703205376  \nk Give the next argument to write_canonical/1.\nn Output a newline character.\nN Only output a newline if the last character output on this stream was  not a newline. Not properly implemented yet.\np Give the next argument to print/1.\nq Give the next argument to writeq/1.  \nr Print integer in radix numeric argument notation. Thus ~16r prints its argument hexadecimal. The argument should  be in the range [2, ... , 36]. Lowercase letters are used for  digits above 9. The colon modifier may be used to form locale-specific  digit groups.  \nR Same as r, but uses uppercase letters for digits above 9.\ns Output text from a list of character codes or a string (see string/1  and section 5.2) from the next  argument.122The s modifier  also accepts an atom for compatibility. This is deprecated due to the  ambiguity of [].\n@ Interpret the next argument as a goal and execute it. Output written to  the current_output stream is inserted at this place. Goal  is called in the module calling format/3.  This option is not present in the original definition by Quintus, but  supported by some other Prolog systems.\nt All remaining space between 2 tab stops is distributed equally over ~t statements between the tab stops. This space is padded  with spaces by default. If an argument is supplied, it is taken to be  the character code of the character used for padding. This can be used  to do left or right alignment, centering, distributing, etc. See also ~|  and ~+ to set tab stops. A tab stop is assumed at the start  of each line.\n| Set a tab stop on the current position. If an argument is supplied set a  tab stop on the position of that argument. This will cause all ~t's to be distributed between the previous and this tab  stop.  \n+ Set a tab stop (as ~|) relative to the last tab stop or the  beginning of the line if no tab stops are set before the ~+.  This constructs can be used to fill fields. The partial format sequence  below prints an integer right-aligned and padded with zeros in 6  columns. The ... sequences in the example illustrate that the integer is  aligned in 6 columns regardless of the remainder of the format  specification.          format('...~|~`0t~d~6+...', [..., Integer, ...])  \nw Give the next argument to write/1.\nW Give the next two arguments to write_term/2.  For example, format('~W', [Term, [numbervars(true)]]).

Both static and dynamic code is processed this  way.48Up to version 7.3.11,  dynamic code was handled using reference counts..  The clause garbage collector (CGC) scans the environment stacks of  all threads for referenced dirty predicates and at which generation this  reference accesses the predicate. It then removes the references for  clauses that have been retracted before the oldest access generation  from the clause list as well as the secondary clauses indexes of the  predicate. If the clause list is not being scanned, the clause  references and ultimately the clause itself is reclaimed. \n\nThe clause garbage collector is called under three conditions, (1)  after reloading a source file, (2) if the memory occupied by  retracted but not yet reclaimed clauses exceeds 12.5% of the program  store, or (3) if skipping dead clauses in the clause lists becomes too  costly. The cost of clause garbage collection is proportional with the  total size of the local stack of all threads (the scanning phase) and  the number of clauses in all `dirty' predicates (the reclaiming phase).\n\n",

Attributes is either a single attribute of a list of  attributes. Each attributes is of the format Name(Value) or Name=Value. Value is the atomic  attribute value but allows for a limited functional notation:  A + B Concatenation of A and BFormat-Arguments Use format/3  and emit the result as quoted value.encode(Atom) Use uri_encoded/3  to create a valid URL query component.location_by_id(ID) HTTP location of the HTTP handler with given ID.

Mime-type is  determined by file_mime_type/2.\nfile(+Type, +File) Send file with content of indicated  mime-type.\nmemory_file(+Type, +Handle) Similar to file(+Type, +File),  but using a memory file instead of a real file. See new_memory_file/1.\ncodes(+Codes) As codes(text/plain, Codes).\ncodes(+Type, +Codes) Send Codes using the indicated  MIME-type.\nbytes(+Type, +Bytes) Send Bytes using the indicated  MIME-type. Bytes is either a string of character codes 0..255 or list of  integers in the range 0..255. Out-of-bound codes result in a  representation error exception.\natom(+Atom) As atom(text/plain, Atom).\natom(+Type, +Atom) Send Atom using the indicated  MIME-type.\ncgi_stream(+Stream, +Len) Read the input from Stream  which, like CGI data starts with a partial HTTP header. The fields of  this header are merged with the provided HdrExtra fields. The  first Len characters of Stream are used.\nform(+ListOfParameter) Send data of the MIME type  application/x-www-form-urlencoded as produced by browsers issuing a POST  request from an HTML form. ListOfParameter is a list of Name=Value or  Name(Value).\nform_data(+ListOfData) Send data of the MIME type multipart/form-data  as produced by browsers issuing a POST request from an HTML form using  enctype multipart/form-data. ListOfData is the same as for  the List alternative described below. Below is an example. Repository,  etc. are atoms providing the value, while the last argument provides a  value from a file.  ..., http_post([ protocol(http),             host(Host),             port(Port),             path(ActionPath)           ],           form_data([ repository = Repository,                       dataFormat = DataFormat,                       baseURI    = BaseURI,                       verifyData = Verify,                       data       = file(File)                     ]),           _Reply,           []), ...,  \nList If the argument is a plain list, it is sent using the MIME type  multipart/mixed and packed using mime_pack/3.

URL is  either an atom specifying a URL or a list representing a  broken-down URL as specified below. After this predicate  succeeds the data can be read from Stream. After completion  this stream must be closed using the built-in Prolog predicate close/1. Options provides  additional options:  authenticate(+Boolean): If false (default true), do not try to  automatically authenticate the client if a 401 (Unauthorized) status  code is received.\n\nauthorization(+Term): Send authorization. See also http_set_authorization/2.  Supported schemes:  basic(+User, +Password)HTTP Basic authentication.bearer(+Token)HTTP Bearer authentication.digest(+User, +Password)HTTP Digest authentication. This option is only provided if the plugin library(http/http_digest)  is also loaded. \n\nconnection(+Connection): Specify the Connection header. Default is close.  The alternative is Keep-alive. This maintains a pool of  available connections as determined by keep_connection/1.  The library(http/websockets) uses Keep-alive, Upgrade.  Keep-alive connections can be closed explicitly using http_close_keep_alive/1.  Keep-alive connections may significantly improve repetitive requests on  the same server, especially if the IP route is long, HTTPS is used or  the connection uses a proxy.\n\nfinal_url(-FinalURL): Unify FinalURL with the final destination. This differs from  the original URL if the returned head of the original  indicates an HTTP redirect (codes 301, 302 or 303). Without a redirect, FinalURL  is the same as URL if URL is an atom, or a URL constructed from the parts.\n\nheader(Name, -AtomValue): If provided, AtomValue is unified with the value of the  indicated field in the reply header. Name is matched  case-insensitive and the underscore (_) matches the hyphen (-). Multiple  of these options may be provided to extract multiple header fields. If  the header is not available AtomValue is unified to the empty atom ('').\n\nheaders(-List): If provided, List is unified with a list of Name(Value) pairs  corresponding to fields in the reply header. Name and Value follow the  same conventions used by the header(Name,Value) option.\n\nmethod(+Method): One of get (default), head, delete, post, put  or patch. The head message can be used in  combination with the header(Name, Value) option to access  information on the resource without actually fetching the resource  itself. The returned stream must be closed immediately.  If post(Data) is provided, the default is post.\n\nsize(-Size): Size is unified with the integer value of Content-Length  in the reply header.\n\nversion(-Version): Version is a pair Major-Minor, where Major  and Minor are integers representing the HTTP version in the  reply header.\n\nrange(+Range): Ask for partial content. Range is a term Unit(From,To),  where From is an integer and To is either an  integer or the atom end. HTTP 1.1 only supports Unit = bytes.  E.g., to ask for bytes 1000-1999, use the option range(bytes(1000,1999))\n\nredirect(+Boolean): If false (default true), do not  automatically redirect if a 3XX code is received. Must be combined with status_code(Code) and one of the header options to read the  redirect reply. In particular, without status_code(Code) a  redirect is mapped to an exception.\n\nstatus_code(-Code): If this option is present and Code unifies with the HTTP  status code, do not translate errors (4xx, 5xx) into an  exception. Instead, http_open/3  behaves as if 200 (success) is returned, providing the application to  read the error document from the returned stream.\n\noutput(-Out): Unify the output stream with Out and do not close it. This  can be used to upgrade a connection.\n\ntimeout(+Timeout): If provided, set a timeout on the stream using set_stream/2.  With this option if no new data arrives within Timeout  seconds the stream raises an exception. Default is to wait forever (infinite).\n\npost(+Data): Issue a POST request on the HTTP server. Data is  handed to http_post_data/3.\n\nproxy(+Host:Port): Use an HTTP proxy to connect to the outside world. See also socket:proxy_for_url/3. This option  overrules the proxy specification defined by socket:proxy_for_url/3.\n\nproxy(+Host, +Port): Synonym for proxy(+Host:Port). Deprecated.\n\nproxy_authorization(+Authorization): Send authorization to the proxy. Otherwise the same as the authorization option.\n\nbypass_proxy(+Boolean): If true, bypass proxy hooks. Default is false.\n\nrequest_header(Name=Value): Additional name-value parts are added in the order of appearance to the  HTTP request header. No interpretation is done.\n\nmax_redirect(+Max): Sets the maximum length of a redirection chain. This is needed for some  IRIs that redirect indefinitely to other IRIs without looping (e.g.,  redirecting to IRIs with a random element in them). Max must be either a non-negative integer or the atom infinite.  The default value is 10.\n\nuser_agent(+Agent): Defines the value of the User-Agent field of the HTTP  header. Default is SWI-Prolog.\n\n  The hook http:open_options/2  can be used to provide default options based on the broken-down URL.  The option status_code(-Code) is particularly useful to query REST  interfaces that commonly return status codes other than 200  that need to be be processed by the client code.\n\nURL is either an atom or string  (url) or a list of parts.

Commandline arguments that specify servers  are processed in the order they appear using the following schema:  \n\nArguments that act as default for all servers.\n--http=Spec or --https=Spec is followed by  arguments for that server until the next --http=Spec or --https=Spec  or the end of the options.\nIf no --http=Spec or --https=Spec appears,  one HTTP server is created from the specified parameters.  Examples: --workers=10 --http --https --http=8080 --https=8443 --http=localhost:8080 --workers=1 --https=8443 --workers=25  \n\n  --port=Port: Start HTTP server at Port. It requires root permission and the option --user=User  to open ports below 1000. The default port is 80. If --https  is used, the default port is 443.\n\n--ip=IP: Only listen to the given IP address. Typically used as --ip=localhost to restrict access to connections from localhost if the server itself is behind an (Apache) proxy server  running on the same host.\n\n--debug=Topic: Enable debugging Topic. See debug/3.\n\n--syslog=Ident: Write debug messages to the syslog daemon using Ident\n\n--user=User: When started as root to open a port below 1000, this option must be  provided to switch to the target user for operating the server. The  following actions are performed as root, i.e., before switching to User:  open the socket(s)\nwrite the pidfile\nsetup syslog interaction\nRead the certificate, key and password file (--pwfile=File)\n\n\n\n--group=Group: May be used in addition to --user. If omitted, the login  group of the target user is used.\n\n--pidfile=File: Write the PID of the daemon process to File.\n\n--output=File: Send output of the process to File. By default, all Prolog console  output is discarded.\n\n--fork[=Bool]: If given as --no-fork or --fork=false, the  process runs in the foreground.\n\n--http[=(Bool|Port|BindTo:Port)]: Create a plain HTTP server. If the argument is missing or true, create at the specified or default address. Else use  the given port and interface. Thus, --http creates a server  at port 80, --http=8080 creates one at port 8080 and --http=localhost:8080  creates one at port 8080 that is only accessible from localhost.\n\n--https[=(Bool|Port|BindTo:Port)]: As --http, but creates an HTTPS server. Use --certfile, --keyfile, -pwfile, --password and --cipherlist to configure SSL  for this server.\n\n--certfile=File: The server certificate for HTTPS.\n\n--keyfile=File: The server private key for HTTPS.\n\n--pwfile=File: File holding the password for accessing the private key. This is  preferred over using --password=PW as it allows using file  protection to avoid leaking the password. The file is read before  the server drops privileges when started with the --user  option.\n\n--password=PW: The password for accessing the private key. See also `--pwfile`.\n\n--cipherlist=Ciphers: One or more cipher strings separated by colons. See the OpenSSL  documentation for more information. Default is DEFAULT.\n\n--interactive[=Bool]: If true (default false) implies --no-fork  and presents the Prolog toplevel after starting the server.\n\n--gtrace=[Bool]: Use the debugger to trace http_daemon/1.\n\n--sighup=Action: Action to perform on kill -HUP <pid>. Default is reload  (running make/0). Alternative is quit,  stopping the server.\n\n  Other options are converted by argv_options/3  and passed to http_server/1.

Options  is a list of option terms describing the type, default, etc. If no  options are specified the parameter must be present and its value is  returned in Value as an atom.

If Value is unbound (i.e. a variable), the record is  considered not specified. The possible option list is ignored. If a  match is found on the remaining fields, the variable is unified with the  value found in the field. \n\nFirst, the system checks whether there is an ordered field that is  specified. In this case, binary search is employed to find the matching  record(s). Otherwise, linear search is used. \n\nIf the match contains a specified field that has the property unique set (see new_table/4), in_table/3  succeeds deterministically.

The include  construct is only honoured if it appears as a directive in a source  file. Textual include (similar to C/C++ #include) is obviously  useful for sharing declarations such as dynamic/1  or multifile/1  by including a file with directives from multiple files that use these  predicates.  Textually including files that contain clauses is less  obvious. Normally, in SWI-Prolog, clauses are owned by the file  in which they are defined. This information is used to replace  the old definition after the file has been modified and is reloaded by,  e.g., make/0.  As we understand it, include/1  is intended to include the same file multiple times. Including a file  holding clauses multiple times into the same module is rather  meaningless as it just duplicates the same clauses. Including a file  holding clauses in multiple modules does not suffer from this problem,  but leads to multiple equivalent copies of predicates. Using use_module/1  can achieve the same result while sharing the predicates. \n\nIf include/1  is used to load files holding clauses, and if these files are loaded  only once, then these include/1  directives can be replaced by other predicates (such as consult/1).  However, there are several cases where either include/1  has no alternative, or using any alternative also requires other  changes. An example of the former is using include/1  to share directives. An example of the latter are cases where clauses of  different predicates are distributed over multiple files: If these files  are loaded with include/1,  the directive discontiguous/1  is appropriate, whereas if they are consulted, one must use the  directive multifile/1. \n\nTo accommodate included files holding clauses, SWI-Prolog  distinguishes between the source location of a clause (in this case the  included file) and the owner of a clause (the file that  includes the file holding the clause). The source location is used by,  e.g., edit/1,  the graphical tracer, etc., while the owner is used to determine which  clauses are removed if the file is modified. Relevant information is  found with the following predicates: \n\n\n\nsource_file/2  describes the owner relation.\npredicate_property/2  describes the source location (of the first clause).\nclause_property/2  provides access to both source and ownership.\nsource_file_property/2  can be used to query include relationships between files.\n\n",

    "description":"load_files(:Files, +Options).\nThe predicate load_files/2  is the parent of all the other loading predicates except for include/1.  It currently supports a subset of the options of Quintus load_files/2. Files  is either a single source file or a list of source files. The  specification for a source file is handed to absolute_file_name/2.  See this predicate for the supported expansions. Options is a  list of options using the format OptionName(OptionValue).  The following options are currently supported: \n\nautoload(Bool): If true (default false), indicate that this  load is a demand load. This implies that, depending on the setting of the  Prolog flag verbose_autoload,  the load action is printed at level informational or silent.  See also print_message/2  and current_prolog_flag/2.\n\nderived_from(File): Indicate that the loaded file is derived from File. Used by make/0  to time-check and load the original file rather than the derived file.\n\ndialect(+Dialect): Load Files with enhanced compatibility with the target Prolog  system identified by Dialect. See expects_dialect/1  and section C for details.\n\nencoding(Encoding): Specify the way characters are encoded in the file. Default is taken  from the Prolog flag encoding.  See section 2.18.1 for details.\n\nexpand(Bool): If true, run the filenames through expand_file_name/2  and load the returned files. Default is false, except for consult/1  which is intended for interactive use. Flexible location of files is  defined by file_search_path/2.\n\nformat(+Format): Used to specify the file format if data is loaded from a stream using  the stream(Stream) option. Default is source,  loading Prolog source text. If qlf, load QLF data (see qcompile/1).\n\nif(Condition): Load the file only if the specified condition is satisfied. The value true loads the file unconditionally, changed  loads the file if it was not loaded before or has been modified since it  was loaded the last time, and not_loaded loads the file if  it was not loaded before.\n\nimports(Import): Specify what to import from the loaded module. The default for use_module/1  is all. Import is passed from the second  argument of use_module/2.  Traditionally it is a list of predicate indicators to import. As part of  the SWI-Prolog/YAP integration, we also support Pred as Name  to import a predicate under another name. Finally, Import can  be the term except(Exceptions), where Exceptions  is a list of predicate indicators that specify predicates that are not  imported or Pred as Name terms to denote renamed  predicates. See also reexport/2  and use_module/2.bugName/Arity  as NewName is currently implemented using a link clause.  This harms efficiency and does not allow for querying the relation  through predicate_property/2.  If Import equals all, all operators are  imported as well. Otherwise, operators are not imported.  Operators can be imported selectively by adding terms op(Pri,Assoc,Name)  to the Import list. If such a term is encountered, all exported  operators that unify with this term are imported. Typically, this  construct will be used with all arguments unbound to import all  operators or with only Name bound to import a particular  operator.\n\nmodified(TimeStamp): Claim that the source was loaded at TimeStamp without  checking the source. This option is intended to be used together with  the stream(Input) option, for example after extracting the  time from an HTTP server or database.\n\nmodule(+Module): Load the indicated file into the given module, overruling the module  name specified in the :- module(Name, ...) directive. This  currently serves two purposes: (1) allow loading two module files that  specify the same module into the same process and force and (2): force  loading source code in a specific module, even if the code provides its  own module name. Experimental.\n\nmust_be_module(Bool): If true, raise an error if the file is not a module file.  Used by use_module/[1,2].\n\nqcompile(Atom): How to deal with quick-load-file compilation by qcompile/1.  Values are:  neverDefault. Do not use qcompile unless called explicitly.autoUse qcompile for all writeable files. See comment below.largeUse qcompile if the file is `large'. Currently, files larger than 100 Kbytes  are considered large.partIf load_files/2  appears in a directive of a file that is compiled into Quick Load Format  using qcompile/1,  the contents of the argument files are included in the .qlf  file instead of the loading directive.  If this option is not present, it uses the value of the Prolog flag qcompile  as default.\n\nredefine_module(+Action): Defines what to do if a file is loaded that provides a module that is  already loaded from another file. Action is one of false  (default), which prints an error and refuses to load the file, or true, which uses unload_file/1  on the old file and then proceeds loading the new file. Finally, there  is ask, which starts interaction with the user. ask  is only provided if the stream user_input is associated  with a terminal.\n\nreexport(Bool): If true re-export the imported predicate. Used by reexport/1  and reexport/2.\n\nregister(Bool): If false, do not register the load location and options.  This option is used by make/0  and load_hotfixes1 to avoid polluting the load-context database. See source_file_property/2.\n\nsandboxed(Bool): Load the file in sandboxed mode. This option controls the flag sandboxed_load.  The only meaningful value for Bool is true. Using false while the  Prolog flag is set to true raises a permission error.\n\nscope_settings(Bool): Scope style_check/1  and expects_dialect/1  to the file and files loaded from the file after the directive. Default  is true. The system and user initialization files (see -f  and -F) are loading with scope_settings(false).\n\nsilent(Bool): If true, load the file without printing a message. The  specified value is the default for all files loaded as a result of  loading the specified files. This option writes the Prolog flag verbose_load  with the negation of Bool.\n\nstream(Input): This SWI-Prolog extension compiles the data from the stream Input. If this option is used, Files must be a  single atom which is used to identify the source location of the loaded  clauses as well as to remove all clauses if the data is reconsulted.  This option is added to allow compiling from non-file locations such  as databases, the web, the user (see consult/1)  or other servers. It can be combined with format(qlf) to  load QLF data from a stream.\n\n  The load_files/2  predicate can be hooked to load other data or data from objects other  than files. See prolog_load_file/2  for a description and library(http/http_load) for an example. All hooks for load_files/2  are documented in section B.8.\n\n",

Two descriptions are shared  if their intermediate description is the same. This means they should  produce the same set of triples in the same order.

First of all it can be used to  ignore type declarations for backward compatibility of this library.  Second it can be used to convert typed literals to a meaningful Prolog  representation. E.g. convert '42' to the Prolog integer 42 if the type  is xsd:int or a related type.\n\nnamespaces(-List): Unify List with a list of NS=URL for  each encountered xmlns:NS=URL  declaration found in the source.\n\nentity(+Name, +Value): Overrule entity declaration in file.

Subject is either a plain  resource (an atom), or one of the terms each(URI) or prefix(URI)  with the obvious meaning. Predicate is either a plain atom  for explicitely non-qualified names or a term NameSpace:Name. If NameSpace is  the defined RDF name space it is returned as the atom rdf.

Source is either a term of the  format stream(StreamHandle) or a file-name. Options is  a list of options controlling the conversion process.  A proper XML document contains only a single toplevel element whose  name matches the document type. Nevertheless, a list is returned for  consistency with the representation of element content. The ListOfContent consists of the following types: \n\nAtom: Atoms are used to represent CDATA. Note this is possible in  SWI-Prolog, as there is no length-limit on atoms and atom garbage  collection is provided.\n\nelement(Name, ListAttributes, ListOfContent): Name is the name of the element. Using SGML, which is  case-insensitive, all element names are returned as lowercase atoms.  ListOfAttributes is a list of Name=Value  pairs for attributes. Attributes of type CDATA are returned  literal. Multi-valued attributes (NAMES, etc.) are  returned as a list of atoms. Handling attributes of the types NUMBER  and NUMBERS depends on the setting of the number(+NumberMode)  attribute through set_sgml_parser/2  or load_structure/3.  By default they are returned as atoms, but automatic conversion to  Prolog integers is supported. ListOfContent defines the  content for the element.\n\nsdata(Text): If an entity with declared content-type SDATA is  encountered, this term is returned holding the data in Text.\n\nndata(Text): If an entity with declared content-type NDATA is  encountered, this term is returned holding the data in Text.\n\npi(Text): If a processing instruction is encountered (<?...?>), Text  holds the text of the processing instruction. Please note that the <?xml ...?> instruction is handled internally.\n\n  The Options list controls the conversion process.  Currently defined options are below. Other options are passed to sgml_parse/2. \n\ndtd(?DTD): Reference to a DTD object. If specified, the <!DOCTYPE ...>  declaration is ignored and the document is parsed and validated against  the provided DTD. If provided as a variable, the created DTD is  returned. See section 3.5.\n\ndialect(+Dialect): Specify the parsing dialect. Supported are sgml (default), html4, html5, html (same as html4, xhtml, xhtml5, xml and xmlns.  See the option dialect of set_sgml_parser/2  for details.\n\nshorttag(+Bool): Define whether SHORTTAG abbreviation is accepted. The default is true  for SGML mode and false for the XML modes. Without SHORTTAG, a / is accepted with warning as part of an  unquoted attribute-value, though /> still closes the  element-tag in XML mode. It may be set to false for parsing HTML  documents to allow for unquoted URLs containing /.\n\nspace(+SpaceMode): Sets the `space-handling-mode' for the initial environment. This mode is  inherited by the other environments, which can override the inherited  value using the XML reserved attribute xml:space. See section 3.2.\n\nnumber(+NumberMode): Determines how attributes of type NUMBER and NUMBERS  are handled. If token (default) they are passed as an atom.  If integer the parser attempts to convert the value to an  integer. If successful, the attribute is passed as a Prolog integer.  Otherwise it is still passed as an atom. Note that SGML defines a  numeric attribute to be a sequence of digits. The -  sign is not allowed and 1 is different from 01. For this reason the  default is to handle numeric attributes as tokens. If conversion to  integer is enabled, negative values are silently accepted.\n\ncase_sensitive_attributes(+Boolean): Treat attribute values as case sensitive. The default is true  for XML and false for SGML and HTML dialects.\n\ncase_preserving_attributes(+Boolean): Treat attribute values as case insensitive but do not alter their case.  The default is false. Setting this option sets the case_sensitive_attributes to the same value. This option  was added to support HTML quasi quotations and most likely has little  value in other contexts.\n\nsystem_entities(+Boolean): Define whether SYSTEM entities are expanded. The default is false.\n\ndefaults(+Bool): Determines how default and fixed values from the DTD are used. By  default, defaults are included in the output if they do not appear in  the source. If false, only the attributes occurring in the  source are emitted.\n\nentity(+Name, +Value): Defines (overwrites) an entity definition. At the moment, only CDATA entities can be specified with this construct.  Multiple entity options are allowed.\n\nfile(+Name): Sets the name of the file on which errors are reported. Sets the  linenumber to 1.\n\nline(+Line): Sets the starting line-number for reporting errors.\n\nmax_memory(+Max): Sets the maximum buffer size in bytes available for input data and CDATA  output. If this limit is reached a resource error is raised. Using max_memory(0)  (the default) means no resource limit will be enforced.\n\ncdata(+Representation): Specify the representation of cdata elements. Supported are atom (default), and string. The choice is not  obvious. Strings are allocated on the Prolog stacks and subject to  normal stack garbage collection. They are quicker to create and avoid  memory fragmentation. But, multiple copies of the same string are stored  multiple times, while the text is shared if atoms are used. Strings are  also useful for security sensitive information as they are invisible to  other threads and cannot be enumerated using, e.g., current_atom/1.  Finally, using strings allows for resource usage limits using the global  stack limit (see set_prolog_stack/2).\n\nattribute_value(+Representation): Specify the representation of attribute values. Supported are atom (default), and string. See above for the  advantages and disadvantages of using strings.\n\nkeep_prefix(+Boolean): If true, xmlns namespaces with prefixes are returned as ns(Prefix, URI) terms. If false (default), the  prefix is ignored and the xmlns namespace is returned as just the URI.\n\n ",

Parameters  is a list of descriptions, one for each parameter. Each parameter  description is one of the following:  default: Uses the ODBC function SQLDescribeParam() to obtain information about  the parameter and apply default rules. See section  2.6 for details. If the interface fails to return a type or the type  is unknown to the ODBC interface a message is printed and the interface  handles the type as text, which implies the user must supply an atom.  The message can be suppressed using the silent(true) option  of odbc_set_connection/2.  An alternative mapping can be selected using the > option  of this predicate described below.\n\nSqlType(Specifier, ...): Declare the parameter to be of type SqlType with the given  specifiers.

SQL statements can be  specified as a plain atom, string or a term of the format Format-Arguments, which is converted using format/2.  If the statement is a SELECT statement the result-set is  returned in RowOrAffected. By default rows are returned  one-by-one on backtracking as terms of the functor row/Arity,  where Arity denotes the number of columns in the result-set.  The library pre-fetches the next value to be able to close the statement  and return deterministic success when returning the last row of the  result-set. Using the option findall/2 (see below) the  result-set is returned as a list of user-specified terms. For other  statements this argument returns affected(Rows), where Rows  represents the number of rows affected by the statement. If you are not  interested in the number of affected rows odbc_query/2  provides a simple interface for sending SQL-statements. \n\nBelow is a small example using the connection created from odbc_connect/3.  Please note that the SQL-statement does not end in the `;'  character. \n\n\n\nlemma(Lemma) :-\n        odbc_query(wordnet,\n                   'SELECT (lemma) FROM word',\n                   row(Lemma)).\n\n  The following example adds a name to a table with parent-relations,  returning the number of rows affected by the statement. Note that the  SQL quote character is the ASCII single quote and, as this SQL  quote is embedded in a single quoted Prolog atom, it must be written as \\'  or '' (two single quotes). We use the first  alternative for better visibility. \n\n\n\ninsert_child(Child, Mother, Father, Affected) :-\n        odbc_query(parents,\n                   'INSERT INTO parents (name,mother,father) \\\n                      VALUES (\\'mary\\', \\'christine\\', \\'bob\\')',\n                   affected(Affected)).\n\n  Options defines the following options. \n\ntypes(ListOfTypes): Determine the Prolog type used to report the column-values. When  omitted, default conversion as described in section  2.6 is implied. A column may specify default to use  default conversion for that column. The length of the type-list must  match the number of columns in the result-set.  For example, in the table word the first column is  defined with the SQL type DECIMAL(6). Using this SQL-type,  ``001'' is distinct from ``1'', but using Prolog integers is a valid  representation for Wordnet wordno identifiers. The  following query extracts rows using Prolog integers: \n\n?- odbc_query(wordnet,\n              'select * from word', X,\n              [ types([integer,default])\n              ]).\n\nX = row(1, entity) ;\nX = row(2, thing) ;\n...\n\n  See also section 2.6 for notes on  type-conversion.\n\nnull(NullSpecifier): Specify SQL NULL representation. See odbc_set_connection/2  for details.\n\nsource(Bool): If true (default false), include the  source-column with each result-value. With this option, each result in  the row/N-term is of the format below. TableName  or ColumnName may be the empty atom if the information is not  available.3This is one possible  interface to this information. In many cases it is more efficient and  convenient to provide this information separately as it is the same for  each result-row. column(TableName, ColumnName, Value)\n\nfindall(Template, row(Column, ... )): Instead of returning rows on backtracking this option makes odbc_query/3  return all rows in a list and close the statement. The option is named  after the Prolog findall/3  predicate, as the it makes odbc_query/3  behave as the commonly used findall/3  construct below.  \n\nlemmas(Lemmas) :-\n        findall(Lemma,\n                odbc_query(wordnet,\n                           'select (lemma) from word',\n                           row(Lemma)),\n                Lemmas).\n\n  Using the findall/2 option the above can be implemented  as below. The number of argument of the row term must match  the number of columns in the result-set. \n\nlemmas(Lemmas) :-\n        odbc_query(wordnet,\n                   'select (lemma) from word',\n                   Lemmas,\n                   [ findall(Lemma, row(Lemma))\n                   ]).\n\n  The current implementation is incomplete. It does not  allow arguments of row(...) to be instantiated. Plain instantiation can always  be avoided using a proper SELECT statement. Potentially useful however  would be the translation of compound terms, especially to translate  date/time/timestamp structures to a format for use by the application.\n\nwide_column_threshold(+Length): Specify threshold column width for using SQLGetData().

NullSpecifier is  an arbitrary Prolog term, though the implementation is optimised for  using an unbound variable, atom and functor with one unbound variable.  The representation null(_) is a commonly used alternative.  The specified default holds for all statements executed on this  connection. Changing the connection default does not affect already  prepared or running statements. The null-value can also be specified at  the statement level.

In time critical applications with wide  columns it may provide better performance at the cost of a higher memory  usage and to work around bugs in SQLGetData().

Type is one of: xf, yf, xfx, xfy, yfx, fy or fx. The `f' indicates the position of the  functor, while x and y indicate the position of the  arguments. `y' should be interpreted as ``on this position  a term with precedence lower or equal to the precedence of the functor  should occur''. For `x' the precedence of the argument must  be strictly lower. The precedence of a term is 0, unless its principal  functor is an operator, in which case the precedence is the precedence  of this operator. A term enclosed in parentheses ( ... )  has precedence 0.  The predefined operators are shown in table  5. Operators can be redefined, unless prohibited by one of the  limitations below. Applications must be careful with (re-)defining  operators because changing operators may cause (other) files to be  interpreted differently. Often this will lead to a syntax error.

SrcDest is normally the  name of a file, represented as an atom or string. Mode is one  of read, write, append or update.  Mode append opens the file for writing, positioning the file  pointer at the end. Mode update opens the file for writing,  positioning the file pointer at the beginning of the file without  truncating the file. Stream is either a variable, in which  case it is bound to an integer identifying the stream, or an atom, in  which case this atom will be the stream identifier.77New  code should use the alias(Alias) option for compatibility  with the ISO standard.  SWI-Prolog also allows SrcDest to be a term pipe(Command).  In this form, Command is started as a child process and if Mode is write, output written to Stream  is sent to the standard input of Command. Viso versa, if Mode  is read, data written by Command to the standard  output may be read from Stream. On Unix systems, Command  is handed to popen() which hands it to the Unix shell. On Windows, Command  is executed directly. See also process_create/3  from library(process). \n\nThe following Options are recognised by open/4: \n\nalias(Atom): Gives the stream a name. Below is an example. Be careful with this  option as stream names are global. See also set_stream/2.  \n\n?- open(data, read, Fd, [alias(input)]).\n\n        ...,\n        read(input, Term),\n        ...\n\n \n\nbom(Bool): Check for a BOM (Byte Order Marker) or write one. If omitted,  the default is true for mode read and false for mode write. See also stream_property/2  and especially section 2.18.1.1  for a discussion of this feature.\n\nbuffer(Buffering): Defines output buffering. The atom full (default) defines  full buffering, line buffering by line, and false  implies the stream is fully unbuffered. Smaller buffering is useful if  another process or the user is waiting for the output as it is being  produced. See also flush_output/[0,1].  This option is not an ISO option.\n\nclose_on_abort(Bool): If true (default), the stream is closed on an abort (see abort/0).  If false, the stream is not closed. If it is an output  stream, however, it will be flushed. Useful for logfiles and if the  stream is associated to a process (using the pipe/1  construct).\n\ncreate(+List): Specifies how a new file is created when opening in write, append or update mode. Currently, List  is a list of atoms that describe the permissions of the created file.78Added  after feedback from Joachim Shimpf and Per Mildner. Defined  values are below. Not recognised values are silently ignored, allowing  for adding platform specific extensions to this set.  readAllow read access to the file.writeAllow write access to the file.executeAllow execution access to the file.defaultAllow read and write access to the file.allAllow any access provided by the OS.  Note that if List is empty, the created file has no  associated access permissions. The create options map to the POSIX mode  option of open(), where read map to 0444, write  to 0222 and execute to 0111. On POSIX systems, the final  permission is defined as (mode & ~umask).\n\nencoding(Encoding): Define the encoding used for reading and writing text to this stream.  The default encoding for type text is derived from the  Prolog flag encoding.  For binary streams the default encoding is octet.  For details on encoding issues, see section  2.18.1.\n\neof_action(Action): Defines what happens if the end of the input stream is reached. Action eof_code makes get0/1  and friends return -1, and read/1  and friends return the atom end_of_file. Repetitive reading  keeps yielding the same result. Action error is like eof_code,  but repetitive reading will raise an error. With action reset,  Prolog will examine the file again and return more data if the file has  grown.\n\nlocale(+Locale): Set the locale that is used by notably format/2  for output on this stream. See section  4.23.\n\nlock(LockingMode): Try to obtain a lock on the open file. Default is none,  which does not lock the file. The value read or shared  means other processes may read the file, but not write it. The value write or exclusive means no other process may  read or write the file.  Locks are acquired through the POSIX function fcntl() using the  command F_SETLKW, which makes a blocked call wait for the lock to  be released. Please note that fcntl() locks are advisory and  therefore only other applications using the same advisory locks honour  your lock. As there are many issues around locking in Unix, especially  related to NFS (network file system), please study the fcntl() manual  page before trusting your locks! The lock option is a SWI-Prolog extension.\n\ntype(Type): Using type text (default), Prolog will write a text file in  an operating system compatible way. Using type binary the  bytes will be read or written without any translation. See also the  option encoding.\n\nwait(Bool): This option can be combined with the lock option. If false (default true), the open call returns  immediately with an exception if the file is locked. The exception has  the format permission_error(lock, source_sink, SrcDest).\n\n  The option reposition is not supported in SWI-Prolog.  All streams connected to a file may be repositioned.\n\n",

Although DCGBody is  typically a callable term that denotes a grammar rule, it can be any term  that is valid as the body of a DCG rule.  The example below calls the rule set integer/3  defined in section 4.13 and available  from library(library(dcg/basics)), binding Rest  to the remainder of the input after matching the integer. \n\n\n\n?- [library(dcg/basics)].\n?- atom_codes('42 times', Codes),\n   phrase(integer(X), Codes, Rest).\nX = 42\nRest = [32, 116, 105, 109, 101, 115]\n\n  The next example exploits a complete body. Given the following  definition of digit_weight1, we can pose the query below. \n\n\n\ndigit_weight(W) -->\n        [D],\n        { code_type(D, digit(W)) }.\n\n  \n\n?- atom_codes('Version 3.4', Codes),\n   phrase((\"Version \",\n           digit_weight(Major),\".\",digit_weight(Minor)),\n          Codes).\nMajor = 3,\nMinor = 4.\n\n  The SWI-Prolog implementation of phrase/3  verifies that the List and Rest arguments are  unbound, bound to the empty list or a list cons cell. Other values raise a type error.65The  ISO standard allows for both raising a type error and accepting any term  as input and output. Note the tail of the list is not checked for  performance reasons. The predicate call_dcg/3  is provided to use grammar rules with terms that are not lists. \n\nNote that the syntax for lists of codes changed in SWI-Prolog version 7  (see section 5.2). If a DCG body  is translated, both \"text\" and `text` is a  valid code-list literal in version 7. A version 7 string (\"text\")  is not acceptable for the second and third arguments of phrase/3.  This is typically not a problem for applications as the input of a DCG  rarely appears in the source code. For testing in the toplevel, one must  use double quoted text in versions prior to 7 and back quoted text  in version 7 or later. \n\nSee also portray_text/1,  which can be used to print lists of character codes as a string to the  top level and debugger to facilitate debugging DCGs that process  character codes. The library library(apply_macros) compiles phrase/3  if the argument is sufficiently instantiated, eliminating the runtime  overhead of translating DCGBody and meta-calling.\n\n",

    "description":"predicate_property(:Head, ?Property).\nTrue when Head refers to a predicate that has property Property. With sufficiently instantiated Head, predicate_property/2  tries to resolve the predicate the same way as calling it would do: if  the predicate is not defined it scans the default modules (see default_module/2)  and finally tries the autoloader. Unlike calling, failure to find the  target predicate causes predicate_property/2  to fail silently. If Head is not sufficiently bound, only  currently locally defined and already imported predicates are  enumerated. See current_predicate/1  for enumerating all predicates. A common issue concerns generating  all built-in predicates. This can be achieved using the code below:  \n\ngenerate_built_in(Name/Arity) :-\n    predicate_property(system:Head, built_in),\n    functor(Head, Name, Arity),\n    \\+ sub_atom(Name, 0, _, _, $).   % discard reserved names\n\n  Property is one of: \n\nautoload(File): True if the predicate can be autoloaded from the file File.  Like undefined, this property is not generated.\n\nbuilt_in: True if the predicate is locked as a built-in predicate. This implies it  cannot be redefined in its definition module and it can normally not be  seen in the tracer.\n\ndefined: True if the predicate is defined. This property is aware of sources  being reloaded, in which case it claims the predicate defined  only if it is defined in another source or it has seen a definition in  the current source. See compile_aux_clauses/1.\n\ndynamic: True if assert/1  and retract/1  may be used to modify the predicate. This property is set using dynamic/1.\n\nexported: True if the predicate is in the public list of the context module.\n\nimported_from(Module): Is true if the predicate is imported into the context module from module Module.\n\nfile(FileName): Unify FileName with the name of the source file in which the  predicate is defined. See also source_file/2  and the property line_count. Note that this reports the file of the first  clause of a predicate. A more robust interface can be achieved using nth_clause/3  and clause_property/2.\n\nforeign: True if the predicate is defined in the C language.\n\nimplementation_module(-Module): True when Module is the module in which Head is or  will be defined. Resolving this property goes through the same search  mechanism as when the an undefined predicate is encountered, but does  not perform any loading. It searches (1) the module inheritence  hierarchy (see default_module/2)  and (2) the autoload index if the unknown  flag is not set to fail in the target module.\n\nindexed(Indexes): Indexes75This predicate  property should be used for analysis and statistics only. The exact  representation of Indexes may change between versions.  is a list of additional (hash) indexes on the predicate. Each element of  the list is a term ArgSpec-Index. Currently ArgSpec is an  integer denoting the argument position and Index is a term hash(Buckets, Speedup, IsList). Here Buckets is  the number of buckets in the hash and Speedup is the expected  speedup relative to trying all clauses linearly. IsList  indicates that a list is created for all clauses with the same key. This  is currently not used.\n\ninterpreted: True if the predicate is defined in Prolog. We return true on this  because, although the code is actually compiled, it is completely  transparent, just like interpreted code.\n\niso: True if the predicate is covered by the ISO standard (ISO/IEC 13211-1).\n\nline_count(LineNumber): Unify LineNumber with the line number of the first clause of  the predicate. Fails if the predicate is not associated with a file. See  also source_file/2.  See also the file property above, notably the reference to clause_property/2.\n\nmultifile: True if there may be multiple (or no) files providing clauses for the  predicate. This property is set using multifile/1.\n\nmeta_predicate(Head): If the predicate is declared as a meta-predicate using meta_predicate/1,  unify Head with the head-pattern. The head-pattern is a  compound term with the same name and arity as the predicate where each  argument of the term is a meta-predicate specifier. See meta_predicate/1  for details.\n\nnodebug: Details of the predicate are not shown by the debugger. This is the  default for built-in predicates. User predicates can be compiled this  way using the Prolog flag generate_debug_info.\n\nnotrace: Do not show ports of this predicate in the debugger.\n\nnumber_of_clauses(ClauseCount): Unify ClauseCount to the number of clauses associated with  the predicate. Fails for foreign predicates.\n\nnumber_of_rules(RuleCount): Unify RuleCount to the number of clauses associated with the  predicate. A rule is defined as a clauses that has a body that  is not just true (i.e., a fact). Fails for foreign  predicates. This property is used to avoid analysing predicates with  only facts in library(prolog_codewalk).\n\npublic: Predicate is declared public using public/1.  Note that without further definition, public predicates are considered  undefined and this property is not reported.\n\nquasi_quotation_syntax: The predicate (with arity 4) is declared to provide quasi quotation  syntax with quasi_quotation_syntax/1.\n\nstatic: The definition can not be modified using assertz/1  and friends. This property is the opposite from dynamic,  i.e., for each defined predicate, either static or dynamic  is true but never both.\n\nthread_local: If true (only possible on the multithreaded version) each thread has its  own clauses for the predicate. This property is set using thread_local/1.\n\ntransparent: True if the predicate is declared transparent using the module_transparent/1  or meta_predicate/1  declaration. In the latter case the property meta_predicate(Head)  is also provided. See chapter 6  for details.\n\nundefined: True if a procedure definition block for the predicate exists, but there  are no clauses for it and it is not declared dynamic or multifile. This  is true if the predicate occurs in the body of a loaded predicate, an  attempt to call it has been made via one of the meta-call predicates,  the predicate has been declared as e.g., a meta-predicate or the  predicate had a definition in the past. Originally used to find missing  predicate definitions. The current implementation of list_undefined/0  used cross-referencing. Deprecated.\n\nvisible: True when predicate can be called without raising a predicate existence  error. This means that the predicate is (1) defined, (2) can be  inherited from one of the default modules (see default_module/2)  or (3) can be autoloaded. The behaviour is logically consistent iff the  property visible is provided explicitly. If the property is left  unbound, only defined predicates are enumerated.\n\nvolatile: If true, the clauses are not saved into a saved state by qsave_program/[1,2].  This property is set using volatile/1.\n\n ",

Kind  describes the nature of the message, while Term is a Prolog term that describes the content. Printing  messages through this indirection instead of using format/3  to the stream user_error allows displaying the message  appropriate to the application (terminal, logfile, graphics), acting on  messages based on their content instead of a string (see message_hook/3)  and creating language specific versions of the messages. See also section 4.11.3.1. The following  message kinds are known:  banner: The system banner message. Banner messages can be suppressed by setting  the Prolog flag verbose  to silent.\n\ndebug(Topic): Message from library(debug). See debug/3.\n\nerror: The message indicates an erroneous situation.

Applications may define message_hook/3  to act upon such messages.\n\ntrace: Messages from the (command line) tracer.\n\nwarning: The message indicates something dubious that is not considered fatal.  For example, discontiguous predicates (see discontiguous/1).\n\n  The predicate print_message/2  first translates the Term into a list of `message lines' (see print_message_lines/3  for details). Next, it calls the hook message_hook/3  to allow the user to intercept the message. If message_hook/3  fails it prints the message unless Kind is silent. \n\nThe print_message/2  predicate and its rules are in the file <plhome>/boot/messages.pl, which may be  inspected for more information on the error messages and related error  terms. If you need to write messages from your own predicates, it is  recommended to reuse the existing message terms if applicable. If no  existing message term is applicable, invent a fairly unique term that  represents the event and define a rule for the multifile predicate  prolog:message//1.

Exe is a file specification as handed to absolute_file_name/3. Typically one use  the path file alias to specify an executable file on the  current PATH. Args is a list of arguments that are handed to  the new process. On Unix systems, each element in the list becomes a  seperate argument in the new process. In Windows, the arguments are  simply concatenated to form the commandline. Each argument itself is  either a primitive or a list of primitives. A primitive is either atomic  or a term file(Spec). Using file(Spec), the  system inserts a filename using the OS filename conventions which is  properly quoted if needed.  Options: \n\nstdin(Spec): stdout(Spec): stderr(Spec): Bind the standard streams of the new process. Spec is one of  the terms below. If pipe(Pipe) is used, the Prolog stream  is a stream in text-mode using the encoding of the default locale. The  encoding can be changed using set_stream/2.

Directory can be  a compound specification, which is converted using absolute_file_name/3.\n\nenv(+List): Specify the environment for the new process. List is a list  of Name=Value terms. Note that the current implementation does not pass  any environment variables. If unspecified, the environment is inherited  from the Prolog process.\n\nprocess(-PID): Unify PID with the process id of the created process.\n\ndetached(+Bool): In Unix: If true, detach the process from the terminal  Currently mapped to setsid(); Also creates a new process  group for the child In Windows: If true, detach the process  from the current job via the CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB flag. In Vista  and beyond, processes launched from the shell directly have the  'compatibility assistant' attached to them automatically unless they  have a UAC manifest embedded in them. This means that you will get a  permission denied error if you try and assign the newly-created PID to a  job you create yourself.\n\nwindow(+Bool): If true, create a window for the process (Windows only)\n\npriority(+Priority): In Unix: specifies the process priority for the newly created process. Priority  must be an integer between -20 and 19. Positive values are nicer to  others, and negative values are less so. The default is zero. Users are  free to lower their own priority. Only the super-user may raise  it to less-than zero.\n\n  If the user specifies the process(-PID) option, he must  call process_wait/2 to reclaim the  process. Without this option, the system will wait for completion of the  process after the last pipe stream is closed. \n\nIf the process is not waited for, it must succeed with status 0. If  not, an process_error is raised. \n\nWindows notes \n\nOn Windows this call is an interface to the CreateProcess() API. The  commandline consists of the basename of Exe and the arguments  formed from Args. Arguments are separated by a single space.  If all characters satisfy iswalnum() it is unquoted. If the  argument contains a double-quote it is quoted using single quotes. If  both single and double quotes appear a domain_error is raised, otherwise  double-quote are used. \n\nThe CreateProcess() API has many options. Currently only the CREATE_NO_WINDOW options is supported through the window(+Bool) option. If omitted, the default is to use  this option if the application has no console. Future versions are  likely to support more window specific options and replace win_exec/2. \n\nExamples \n\nFirst, a very simple example that behaves the same as shell('ls -l'), except for error handling: \n\n\n\n?- process_create(path(ls), ['-l'], []).\n\n  The following example uses grep to find all matching lines in a file. \n\n\n\ngrep(File, Pattern, Lines) :-\n        setup_call_cleanup(\n            process_create(path(grep), [ Pattern, file(File) ],\n                           [ stdout(pipe(Out))\n                           ]),\n            read_lines(Out, Lines),\n            close(Out)).\n\nread_lines(Out, Lines) :-\n        read_line_to_codes(Out, Line1),\n        read_lines(Line1, Out, Lines).\n\nread_lines(end_of_file, _, []) :- !.\nread_lines(Codes, Out, [Line|Lines]) :-\n        atom_codes(Line, Codes),\n        read_line_to_codes(Out, Line2),\n        read_lines(Line2, Out, Lines).\n\n  Errors: process_error(Exe, Status) where Status is one of exit(Code) or killed(Signal).

It is intended to allow a  program adding additional context to an exception to simplify diagnosing  the problem. ExceptionIn is the exception term as raised by throw/1  or one of the built-in predicates. The output argument ExceptionOut  describes the exception that is actually raised. Frame is the  innermost frame. See prolog_frame_attribute/3  and the library library(prolog_stack) for getting information from this. CatcherFrame is a reference to the frame calling the matching catch/3, none  if the exception is not caught or 'C' if the exception is  caught in C calling Prolog using the flag PL_Q_CATCH_EXCEPTION.  The hook is run in `nodebug' mode. If it succeeds, ExceptionOut  is considered the current exception. If it fails, ExceptionIn  is used for further processing. The hook is never called  recursively. The hook is not allowed to modify ExceptionOut  in such a way that it no longer unifies with the catching frame. \n\nTypically, prolog_exception_hook/4  is used to fill the second argument of error(Formal, Context)  exceptions. Formal is defined by the ISO standard, while  SWI-Prolog defines Context as a term context(Location,  Message). Location is bound to a term <name>/<arity>  by the kernel. This hook can be used to add more information on the  calling context, such as a full stack trace. \n\nApplications that use exceptions as part of normal processing must do  a quick test of the environment before starting expensive gathering  information on the state of the program. \n\nThe hook can call trace/0  to enter trace mode immediately. For example, imagine an application  performing an unwanted division by zero while all other errors are  expected and handled. We can force the debugger using the hook  definition below. Run the program in debug mode (see debug/0)  to preserve as much as possible of the error context. \n\n\n\nuser:prolog_exception_hook(\n         error(evaluation_error(zero_divisor), _),\n         _, _, _) :-\n        trace, fail.\n\n  \n\n",

To signal end-of-file, unify stream with an empty text, e.g., stream_read(Stream, \"\").\n\nModule : stream_close(+Stream): Called when the stream is closed. This predicate must succeed. The  callback can be used to cleanup associated resources.\n\n  The current implementation only deals with text streams. The stream  uses the wchar_t encoding. The buffer size must be a  multiple of wchar_t, i.e., a multiple of four for  portability. The newline mode of the stream is posix  on all platforms, disabling the translation \"\\n\" --> \"\\r\\n\".\n\nOptions is currently ignored.   bug: Futher versions might require additional callbacks. As we demand all  callbacks to be defined, existing code needs to implement the new  callbacks.\n\n ",

    "description":"prolog_trace_interception(+Port, +Frame, +Choice, -Action).\nDynamic predicate, normally not defined. This predicate is called from  the SWI-Prolog debugger just before it would show a port. If this  predicate succeeds, the debugger assumes that the trace action has been  taken care of and continues execution as described by Action.  Otherwise the normal Prolog debugger actions are performed.  Port denotes the reason to activate the tracer (`port' in  the 4/5-port, but with some additions): \n\ncall: Normal entry through the call port of the 4-port debugger.\n\nredo(PC): Normal entry through the redo port of the 4-port debugger. The redo port signals resuming a predicate to generate  alternative solutions. If PC is 0 (zero), clause indexing has  found another clause that will be tried next. Otherwise, PC  is the program counter in the current clause where execution continues.  This implies we are dealing with an in-clause choice point left by,  e.g., ;/2. Note that  non-determinism in foreign predicates are also handled using an  in-clause choice point.\n\nunify: The unify port represents the neck instruction, signalling the  end of the head-matching process. This port is normally invisible. See leash/1  and visible/1.\n\nexit: The exit port signals the goal is proved. It is possible for the goal to  have alternatives. See prolog_frame_attribute/3  to examine the goal stack.\n\nfail: The fail port signals final failure of the goal.\n\nexception(Except): An exception is raised and still pending. This port is activated on each  parent frame of the frame generating the exception until the exception  is caught or the user restarts normal computation using retry. Except is the pending exception term.\n\nbreak(PC): A break instruction is executed. PC is program  counter. This port is used by the graphical debugger.\n\ncut_call(PC): A cut is encountered at PC. This port is used by the  graphical debugger to visualise the effect of the cut.\n\ncut_exit(PC): A cut has been executed. See cut_call(PC) for more  information.\n\n  Frame is a reference to the current local stack frame,  which can be examined using prolog_frame_attribute/3. Choice  is a reference to the last choice point and can be examined using prolog_choice_attribute/3. Action  must be unified with a term that specifies how execution must continue.  The following actions are defined: \n\nabort: Abort execution. See abort/0.\n\ncontinue: Continue (i.e., creep in the command line debugger).\n\nfail: Make the current goal fail.\n\nignore: Step over the current goal without executing it.\n\nnodebug: Continue execution in normal nodebugging mode. See nodebug/0.\n\nretry: Retry the current frame.\n\nretry(Frame): Retry the given frame. This must be a parent of the current frame.\n\nskip: Skip over the current goal (i.e., skip in the command line  debugger).\n\nup: Skip to the parent goal (i.e., up in the command line  debugger).\n\n  Together with the predicates described in section  4.39 and the other predicates of this chapter, this predicate  enables the Prolog user to define a complete new debugger in Prolog.  Besides this, it enables the Prolog programmer to monitor the execution  of a program. The example below records all goals trapped by the tracer  in the database. \n\n\n\nprolog_trace_interception(Port, Frame, _PC, continue) :-\n        prolog_frame_attribute(Frame, goal, Goal),\n        prolog_frame_attribute(Frame, level, Level),\n        recordz(trace, trace(Port, Level, Goal)).\n\n  To trace the execution of `go' this way the following query should be  given: \n\n\n\n?- trace, go, notrace.\n\n ",

This  predicate deals with XML with or without namespaces. If namespace  identifiers are not provided they are generated. This predicate defines  the following Options  dtd(DTD): Specify the DTD. In SGML documents the DTD is required to distinguish  between elements that are declared empty in the DTD and elements that  just happen to have no content. Further optimisation (shortref, omitted  tags, etc.) could be considered in the future. The DTD is also used to  find the declared named character entities.\n\ndoctype(Doctype): Document type to include in the header. When omitted it is taken from  the outer element.\n\nheader(Bool): If Bool is false, the XML header is suppressed.  Useful for embedding in other XML streams.\n\nlayout(Bool): Do/do not emit layout characters to make the output readable, Default is  to emit layout. With layout enabled, elements only containing other  elements are written using increasing indentation. This introduces  (depending on the mode and defined whitespace handling) CDATA sequences  with only layout between elements when read back in. If false,  no layout characters are added. As this mode does not need to analyse  the document it is faster and guarantees correct output when read back.  Unfortunately the output is hardly human readable and causes problems  with many editors.\n\nindent(Integer): Set the initial element indentation. It more than zero, the indent is  written before the document.\n\nnsmap(Map): Set the initial namespace map. Map is a list of Name = URI. This option, together with header  and ident is added to use xml_write/3  to generate XML that is embedded in a larger XML document.\n\nnet(Bool): Use/do not use Null End Tags. For XML, this applies only to  empty elements, so you get <foo/> (default, net(true)) or <foo><\/foo> (net(false)).  For SGML, this applies to empty elements, so you get <foo>  (if foo is declared to be EMPTY in the DTD), <foo><\/foo> (default, net(false))  or <foo// (net(true)). In SGML code, short  character content not containing / can be  emitted as <b>xxx<\/b> (default, net(false)  or <b/xxx/ (net(true))\n\n ",

If this list is empty, the behaviour is the same as  for read/1.  The options are upward compatible with Quintus Prolog. The argument  order is according to the ISO standard. Syntax errors are always  reported using exception-handling (see catch/3).  Options:  backquoted_string(Bool): If true, read `...` to a string  object (see section 5.2). The default depends  on the Prolog flag back_quotes.\n\ncharacter_escapes(Bool): Defines how to read \\ escape sequences in quoted atoms. See  the Prolog flag character_escapes  in current_prolog_flag/2.  (SWI-Prolog).\n\ncomments(-Comments): Unify Comments with a list of Position-Comment,  where Position is a stream position object (see stream_position_data/3)  indicating the start of a comment and Comment is a string  object containing the text including delimiters of a comment. It returns  all comments from where the read_term/2  call started up to the end of the term read.\n\ncycles(Bool): If true (default false), re-instantiate  templates as produced by the corresponding write_term/2  option. Note that the default is false to avoid  misinterpretation of @(Template, Substutions), while the  default of write_term/2  is true because emitting cyclic terms without using the  template construct produces an infinitely large term (read: it will  generate an error after producing a huge amount of output).\n\ndotlists(Bool): If true (default false), read .(a,[])  as a list, even if lists are internally nor constructed using the dot as  functor. This is primarily intended to read the output from write_canonical/1  from other Prolog systems. See section  5.1.\n\ndouble_quotes(Atom): Defines how to read \" ... \" strings. See the Prolog flag double_quotes.  (SWI-Prolog).\n\nmodule(Module): Specify Module for operators, character_escapes  flag and double_quotes  flag. The value of the latter two is overruled if the corresponding read_term/3  option is provided. If no module is specified, the current `source  module' is used. (SWI-Prolog).\n\nquasi_quotations(-List): If present, unify List with the quasi quotations (see section A.27) instead of  evaluating quasi quotations. Each quasi quotation is a term quasi_quotation(+Syntax,  +Quotation, +VarDict, -Result), where Syntax is the  term in {|Syntax||..|}, Quotation is a list of character  codes that represent the quotation, VarDict is a list of Name=Variable and Result is a variable  that shares with the place where the quotation must be inserted. This  option is intended to support tools that manipulate Prolog source text.\n\nsingletons(Vars): As variable_names, but only reports the variables occurring  only once in the Term read. Variables starting with an  underscore (`_') are not included in this list. (ISO). If Vars  is the constant warning, singleton variables are reported  using print_message/2.  The variables appear in the order they have been read.\n\nsyntax_errors(Atom): If error (default), throw an exception on a syntax error.  Other values are fail, which causes a message to be printed  using print_message/2,  after which the predicate fails, quiet which causes the  predicate to fail silently, and dec10 which causes syntax  errors to be printed, after which read_term/[2,3]  continues reading the next term. Using dec10, read_term/[2,3]  never fails. (Quintus, SICStus).\n\nsubterm_positions(TermPos): Describes the detailed layout of the term. The formats for the various  types of terms are given below. All positions are character positions.  If the input is related to a normal stream, these positions are relative  to the start of the input; when reading from the terminal, they are  relative to the start of the term.  From-ToUsed for primitive types (atoms, numbers, variables).string_position(From, To)Used to indicate the position of a string enclosed in double quotes (\").brace_term_position(From, To, Arg)Term of the form {...}, as used in DCG rules. Arg  describes the argument.list_position(From, To, Elms, Tail)A list. Elms describes the positions of the elements. If the  list specifies the tail as |<TailTerm> , Tail  is unified with the term position of the tail, otherwise with the atom none.term_position(From, To, FFrom, FTo, SubPos)Used for a compound term not matching one of the above. FFrom  and FTo describe the position of the functor. SubPos  is a list, each element of which describes the term position of the  corresponding subterm.dict_position(From, To, TagFrom, TagTo, KeyValuePosList)Used for a dict (see section 5.4).  The position of the key-value pairs is described by KeyValuePosList,  which is a list of key_value_position/7 terms. The key_value_position/7  terms appear in the order of the input. Because maps to not preserve  ordering, the key is provided in the position description.key_value_position(From, To, SepFrom, SepTo, Key, KeyPos, ValuePos)Used for key-value pairs in a map (see section  5.4). It is similar to the term_position/5 that would  be created, except that the key and value positions do not need an  intermediate list and the key is provided in Key to enable  synchronisation of the file position data with the data structure.parentheses_term_position(From, To, ContentPos)Used for terms between parentheses. This is an extension compared to the  original Quintus specification that was considered necessary for secure  refactoring of terms.quasi_quotation_position(From, To, SyntaxFrom, SyntaxTo, ContentPos)Used for quasi quotations. \n\nterm_position(Pos): Unifies Pos with the starting position of the term read. Pos  is of the same format as used by stream_property/2.\n\nvar_prefix(Bool): If true, demand variables to start with an underscore. See section 2.15.1.7.\n\nvariables(Vars): Unify Vars with a list of variables in the term. The  variables appear in the order they have been read. See also term_variables/2.  (ISO).\n\nvariable_names(Vars): Unify Vars with a list of `Name = Var',  where Name is an atom describing the variable name and Var  is a variable that shares with the corresponding variable in Term.

Class  describes the kind of object stored in the resource. In the current  implementation, it is just an atom. FileSpec is a file  specification that may exploit file_search_path/2  (see absolute_file_name/2).  Normally, resources are defined as unit clauses (facts), but the  definition of this predicate also allows for rules.

Method  is one of bof, current or eof,  indicating positioning relative to the start, current point or end of  the underlying object. NewLocation is unified with the new  offset, relative to the start of the stream.  Positions are counted in `units'. A unit is 1 byte, except for text  files using 2-byte Unicode encoding (2 bytes) or wchar encoding  (sizeof(wchar_t)). The latter guarantees comfortable interaction with  wide-character text objects. Otherwise, the use of seek/4  on non-binary files (see open/4)  is of limited use, especially when using multi-byte text encodings (e.g. UTF-8)  or multi-byte newline files (e.g. DOS/Windows). On text files,  SWI-Prolog offers reliable backup to an old position using stream_property/2  and set_stream_position/2.  Skipping N character codes is achieved calling get_code/2 N  times or using copy_stream_data/3,  directing the output to a null stream (see open_null_stream/1).  If the seek modifies the current location, the line number and character  position in the line are set to 0. \n\nIf the stream cannot be repositioned, a permission_error  is raised. If applying the offset would result in a file position less  than zero, a domain_error is raised. Behaviour when seeking  to positions beyond the size of the underlying object depend on the  object and possibly the operating system.

Specifically, an IRI term is not required to follow the IRI standard  grammar.Abbreviated IRI notation that allows IRI prefix aliases that are  registered by rdf_register_prefix/[2,3] to be used. Their notation is Alias:Local,  where Alias and Local are atoms. Each abbreviated IRI is expanded by the  system to a full IRI.  \nLiterals appear in two notations:  String@Lang A language-tagged string, where String is a Prolog  string and Lang is an atom.Value^^Type A type qualified literal. For  unknown types, Value is a Prolog string. If type is known, the Prolog  representations from the table below are used.

Future versions of SWI-Prolog  may introduce decimal as a subtype of rational.  (2) SS fields denote the number of seconds. This  can either be an integer or a float.  (3) The date_time structure can have a 7th  field that denotes the timezone offset in seconds as an integer.  In addition, a ground object value is translated into a  properly typed RDF literal using rdf_canonical_literal/2. \n\nThere is a fine distinction in how duplicate statements are handled  in rdf/[3,4]: backtracking over rdf/3  will never return duplicate triples that appear in multiple graphs. rdf/4  will return such duplicate triples, because their graph term differs.\n\nS is the subject term. It is  either a blank node or IRI. P is the predicate term. It is  always an IRI. O is the object term. It is  either a literal, a blank node or IRI (except for true and false  that denote the values of datatype XSD boolean). G is the graph term. It is  always an IRI.

    "description":"rdf_monitor(:Goal, +Mask).\nGoal is called for modifications of the database. It is  called with a single argument that describes the modification. Defined  events are:  assert(+S, +P, +O, +DB): A triple has been asserted.\n\nretract(+S, +P, +O, +DB): A triple has been deleted.\n\nupdate(+S, +P, +O, +DB, +Action): A triple has been updated.\n\nnew_literal(+Literal): A new literal has been created. Literal is the argument of literal(Arg) of the triple's object. This event is  introduced in version 2.5.0 of this library.\n\nold_literal(+Literal): The literal Literal is no longer used by any triple.\n\ntransaction(+BeginOrEnd, +Id): Mark begin or end of the commit of a transaction started by rdf_transaction/2. BeginOrEnd  is begin(Nesting) or end(Nesting). Nesting expresses the nesting  level of transactions, starting at `0' for a toplevel transaction. Id  is the second argument of rdf_transaction/2.  The following transaction Ids are pre-defined by the library:  parse(Id)A file is loaded using rdf_load/2. Id  is one of file(Path) or stream(Stream).unload(DB)All triples with source DB are being unloaded using rdf_unload/1.resetIssued by rdf_reset_db/0. \n\nload(+BeginOrEnd, +Spec): Mark begin or end of rdf_load_db/1  or load through rdf_load/2  from a cached file. Spec is currently defined as file(Path).\n\nrehash(+BeginOrEnd): Marks begin/end of a re-hash due to required re-indexing or garbage  collection.\n\n  Mask is a list of events this monitor is interested in.  Default (empty list) is to report all events. Otherwise each element is  of the form +Event or -Event to include or exclude monitoring for  certain events. The event-names are the functor names of the events  described above. The special name all refers to all events  and assert(load) to assert events originating from rdf_load_db/1.  As loading triples using rdf_load_db/1  is very fast, monitoring this at the triple level may seriously harm  performance. \n\nThis predicate is intended to maintain derived data, such as a  journal, information for undo, additional indexing in literals,  etc. There is no way to remove registered monitors. If this is required  one should register a monitor that maintains a dynamic list of  subscribers like the XPCE broadcast library. A second subscription of  the same hook predicate only re-assignes the mask. \n\nThe monitor hooks are called in the order of registration and in the  same thread that issued the database manipulation. To process all  changes in one thread they should be send to a thread message queue. For  all updating events, the monitor is called while the calling thread has  a write lock on the RDF store. This implies that these events are  processed strickly synchronous, even if modifications originate from  multiple threads. In particular, the transaction begin,  ... updates ... end sequence is never interleaved with  other events. Same for load and parse.\n\n",

See stream_property/2.\n\nencoding(Atom): Defines the mapping between bytes and character codes used for the  stream. See section 2.18.1 for  supported encodings. The value bom causes the stream to check whether the current  character is a Unicode BOM marker. If a BOM marker is found, the  encoding is set accordingly and the call succeeds. Otherwise the call  fails.\n\neof_action(Action): Set end-of-file handling to one of eof_code, reset  or error.\n\nfile_name(FileName): Set the filename associated to this stream. This call can be used to set  the file for error locations if Stream corresponds to FileName and is not obtained by opening the file directly  but, for example, through a network service.\n\nline_position(LinePos): Set the line position attribute of the stream. This feature is intended  to correct position management of the stream after sending a terminal  escape sequence (e.g., setting ANSI character attributes).

The value infinite (default) makes the stream block  indefinitely. Like wait_for_input/3,  this call only applies to streams that support the select() system call.  For further information about timeout handling, see wait_for_input/3.  The exception is of the form error(timeout_error(read, Stream), _)\n\ntype(Type): Set the type of the stream to one of text or binary.  See also open/4  and the encoding property of streams.

A good practice to improve somewhat on this situation is to make  sure that terms whose arguments are subject to setarg/3  have one unused and unshared variable in addition to the used arguments.  This variable avoids unwanted sharing in, e.g., copy_term/2,  and causes the term to be considered as non-ground. An alternative is to  use put_attr/3  to attach information to attributed variables (see section  7.1).\n\n",

If Setup succeeds, Cleanup  will be called exactly once after Goal is finished: either on  failure, deterministic success, commit, or an exception. The execution  of Setup is protected from asynchronous interrupts like call_with_time_limit/2  (package clib) or thread_signal/2.  In most uses, Setup will perform temporary side-effects required by Goal  that are finally undone by Cleanup.  Success or failure of Cleanup is ignored, and choice  points it created are destroyed (as once/1).  If Cleanup throws an exception, this is executed as normal.bugDuring  the execution of Cleanup, garbage collection and stack-shifts  are disabled. \n\nTypically, this predicate is used to cleanup permanent data storage  required to execute Goal, close file descriptors, etc. The  example below provides a non-deterministic search for a term in a file,  closing the stream as needed. \n\n\n\nterm_in_file(Term, File) :-\n        setup_call_cleanup(open(File, read, In),\n                           term_in_stream(Term, In),\n                           close(In) ).\n\nterm_in_stream(Term, In) :-\n        repeat,\n        read(In, T),\n        (   T == end_of_file\n        ->  !, fail\n        ;   T = Term\n        ).\n\n  Note that it is impossible to implement this predicate in Prolog. The  closest approximation would be to read all terms into a list, close the  file and call member/2.  Without setup_call_cleanup/3  there is no way to gain control if the choice point left by repeat/0  is removed by a cut or an exception. \n\nsetup_call_cleanup/3  can also be used to test determinism of a goal, providing a portable  alternative to deterministic/1: \n\n\n\n?- setup_call_cleanup(true,(X=1;X=2), Det=yes).\n\nX = 1 ;\n\nX = 2,\nDet = yes ;\n\n  This predicate is under consideration for inclusion into the ISO  standard.

    "description":"sgml_parse(+Parser, +Options).\nParse an XML file. The parser can operate in two input and two output  modes. Output is either a structured term as described with load_structure/2  or call-backs on predefined events. The first is especially suitable for  manipulating not-too-large documents, while the latter provides a  primitive means for handling very large documents.  Input is a stream. A full description of the option-list is below. \n\ndocument(-Term): A variable that will be unified with a list describing the content of  the document (see load_structure/2).\n\nsource(+Stream): An input stream that is read. This option must be given.\n\ncontent_length(+Characters): Stop parsing after Characters. This option is useful to parse  input embedded in envelopes, such as the HTTP protocol.\n\nparse(Unit): Defines how much of the input is parsed. This option is used to parse  only parts of a file.  fileDefault. Parse everything upto the end of the input.elementThe parser stops after reading the first element. Using source(Stream), this implies reading is stopped as soon as  the element is complete, and another call may be issued on the same  stream to read the next element.contentThe value content is like element but assumes  the element has already been opened. It may be used in a call-back from call(on_begin, Pred) to parse individual  elements after validating their headers.declarationThis may be used to stop the parser after reading the first declaration.  This is especially useful to parse only the doctype  declaration.inputThis option is intended to be used in conjunction with the allowed(Elements) option of get_sgml_parser/2.  It disables the parser's default to complete the parse-tree by closing  all open elements. \n\nmax_errors(+MaxErrors): Set the maximum number of errors. If this number is exceeded further  writes to the stream will yield an I/O error exception. Printing of  errors is suppressed after reaching this value. The default is 50. Using max_errors(-1)  makes the parser continue, no matter how many errors it encounters. error(limit_exceeded(max_errors, Max), _)\n\nsyntax_errors(+ErrorMode): Defines how syntax errors are handled.  quietSuppress all messages.printDefault. Pass messages to print_message/2.stylePrint dubious input such as attempts for redefinitions in the DTD using print_message/2  with severity informational. \n\nxml_no_ns(+Mode): Error handling if an XML namespace is not defined. Default generates an  error. If quiet, the error is suppressed. Can be used  together with call(urlns, Closure) to provide external  expansion of namespaces. See also section  3.3.1.\n\ncall(+Event, :PredicateName): Issue call-backs on the specified events. PredicateName is  the name of the predicate to call on this event, possibly prefixed with  a module identifier. If the handler throws an exception, parsing is  stopped and sgml_parse/2  re-throws the exception. The defined events are:  beginAn open-tag has been parsed. The named handler is called with three  arguments: Handler(+Tag, +Attributes, +Parser).endA close-tag has been parsed. The named handler is called with two  arguments: Handler(+Tag, +Parser).cdataCDATA has been parsed. The named handler is called with two arguments: Handler(+CDATA, +Parser), where CDATA is an atom  representing the data.piA processing instruction has been parsed. The named handler is called  with two arguments: Handler(+Text, +Parser),  where Text is the text of the processing instruction.declA declaration (<!...>) has been read. The named  handler is called with two arguments: Handler(+Text,  +Parser), where Text is the text of the declaration  with comments removed.  This option is expecially useful for highlighting declarations and  comments in editor support, where the location of the declaration is  extracted using get_sgml_parser/2.errorAn error has been encountered. the named handler is called with three  arguments: Handler(+Severity, +Message, +Parser),  where Severity is one of warning or error  and Message is an atom representing the diagnostic message. The  location of the error can be determined using get_sgml_parser/2  If this option is present, errors and warnings are not reported using print_message/3xmlnsWhen parsing an in xmlns mode, a new namespace declaraction  is pushed on the environment. The named handler is called with three  arguments: Handler(+NameSpace, +URL, +Parser).  See section 3.3.1 for details.urlnsWhen parsing an in xmlns mode, this predicate can be used  to map a url into either a canonical URL for this namespace or another  internal identifier. See section 3.3.1  for details. \n\n ",

If the command ends with a & sign, the command is handed to the WinExec() API,  which does not wait for the new task to terminate. See also win_exec/2  and win_shell/2.  Please note that the CreateProcess() API does not imply the  Windows command interpreter (cmd.exe and therefore commands that  are built in the command interpreter can only be activated using the  command interpreter. For example, a file can be compied using the  command below. \n\n\n\n?- shell('cmd.exe /C copy file1.txt file2.txt').\n\n  Note that many of the operations that can be achieved using the shell  built-in commands can easily be achieved using Prolog primitives. See make_directory/1, delete_file/1, rename_file/2,  etc. The clib package provides library(filesex),  implementing various high level file operations such as copy_file/2.  Using Prolog primitives instead of shell commands improves the  portability of your program. \n\nThe library library(process) provides process_create/3  and several related primitives that support more fine-grained  interaction with processes, including I/O redirection and management of  asynchronous processes.\n\n",

ECLiPSe currently only accepts <, =<, >  and >= for the Order argument  but this is likely to change. SWI-Prolog extends this predicate to deal  with dicts.  If Key is the integer zero (0), the entire term is used to  compare two elements. Using Key=0 can be used to sort  arbitrary Prolog terms. Other values for Key can only be used  with compound terms or dicts (see section  5.4). An integer key extracts the Key-th argument from a  compound term. An integer or atom key extracts the value from a dict  that is associated with the given key. A type_error is raised if the  list element is of the wrong type and an existence_error is raised if  the compound has not enough argument or the dict does not contain the  requested key. \n\nDeeper nested elements of structures can be selected by using a list  of keys for the Key argument. \n\nThe Order argument is described in the table below119For  compatibility with ECLiPSe, the values <, =<, >  and >= are allowed as synonyms. \n\n\n\nOrderOrderingDuplicate handling @< ascendingremove @=< ascendingkeep @> descendingremove @>= descendingkeep   The sort is stable, which implies that, if duplicates are  kept, the order of duplicates is not changed.

The context defines several properties  of the SSL connection such as involved keys, preferred  encryption, and passwords. After establishing a context, an SSL  connection can be negotiated using ssl_negotiate/5,  turning two arbitrary plain Prolog streams into encrypted streams. This  predicate processes the options below.  host(+HostName): For the client, the host to which it connects. This option should be specified when Role is client.  Otherwise, certificate verification may fail when negotiating a secure  connection.\n\ncertificate_file(+FileName): Specify where the certificate file can be found. This can be the same as  the key_file(+FileName) option. A server must have  at least one certificate before clients can connect. A client must have a certificate only if the server demands the client to  identify itself with a client certificate using the peer_cert(true) option. If a certificate is provided, it is  necessary to also provide a matching private key via the key_file/1 option. To configure multiple  certificates, use the option certificate_key_pairs/1  instead. Alternatively, use ssl_add_certificate_key/4  to add certificates and keys to an existing context.\n\nkey_file(+FileName): Specify where the private key that matches the certificate can be found.  If the key is encrypted with a password, this must be supplied using the password(+Text)  or pem_password_hook(:Goal) option.\n\ncertificate_key_pairs(+Pairs): Alternative method for specifying certificates and keys. The argument is  a list of pairs of the form Certificate-Key, where each component  is a string or an atom that holds, respectively, the PEM-encoded  certificate and key. To each certificate, further certificates of the  chain can be appended. Multiple types of certificates can be present at  the same time to enable different ciphers. Using multiple certificate  types with completely independent certificate chains requires OpenSSL  1.0.2 or greater.\n\npassword(+Text): Specify the password the private key is protected with (if any). If you  do not want to store the password you can also specify an application  defined handler to return the password (see next option). Text  is either an atom or string. Using a string is preferred as strings are  volatile and local resources.\n\npem_password_hook(:Goal): In case a password is required to access the private key the supplied  predicate will be called to fetch it. The hook is called as call(Goal, +SSL, -Password)  and typically unifies Password with a string containing the password.\n\nrequire_crl(+Boolean): If true (default is false), then all certificates will be considered  invalid unless they can be verified as not being revoked. You can do  this explicity by passing a list of CRL filenames via the crl/1  option, or by doing it yourself in the cert_verify_hook. If you specify require_crl(true)  and provide neither of these options, verification will necessarily fail\n\ncrl(+ListOfFileNames): Provide a list of filenames of PEM-encoded CRLs that will be given to  the context to attempt to establish that a chain of certificates is not  revoked. You must also set require_crl(true) if you want  CRLs to actually be checked by OpenSSL.\n\ncacert_file(+FileName): Specify a file containing certificate keys of trusted  certificates. The peer is trusted if its certificate is signed  (ultimately) by one of the provided certificates. Using the FileName system(root_certificates)  uses a list of trusted root certificates as provided by the OS. See system_root_certificates/1  for details.  Additional verification of the peer certificate as well as accepting  certificates that are not trusted by the given set can be realised using  the hook cert_verify_hook(:Goal).\n\ncert_verify_hook(:Goal): The predicate ssl_negotiate/5  calls Goal as follows:  \n\ncall(Goal, +SSL,\n     +ProblemCertificate, +AllCertificates, +FirstCertificate,\n     +Error)\n\n  In case the certificate was verified by one of the provided  certifications from the cacert_file option, Error is  unified with the atom verified. Otherwise it contains the  error string passed from OpenSSL. Access will be granted iff the  predicate succeeds. See load_certificate/2  for a description of the certificate terms. See cert_accept_any/5  for a dummy implementation that accepts any certificate.\n\ncipher_list(+Atom): Specify a cipher preference list (one or more cipher strings separated  by colons, commas or spaces).\n\necdh_curve(+Atom): Specify a curve for ECDHE ciphers. If this option is not specified, the  OpenSSL default parameters are used. With OpenSSL prior to 1.1.0, prime256v1  is used by default.\n\npeer_cert(+Boolean): Trigger the request of our peer's certificate while establishing the SSL  layer. This option is automatically turned on in a client SSL  socket. It can be used in a server to ask the client to identify itself  using an SSL certificate.\n\nclose_parent(+Boolean): If true, close the raw streams if the SSL  streams are closed. Default is false.\n\nclose_notify(+Boolean): If true (default is false), the server sends  TLS close_notify when closing the connection. In addition, this  mitigates truncation attacks for both client and server role: If  EOF is encountered without having received a TLS shutdown, an exception  is raised. Well-designed protocols are self-terminating, and this attack  is therefore very rarely a concern.\n\nmin_protocol_version(+Atom): Set the minimum protocol version that can be negotiated. Atom is one of sslv3, tlsv1, tlsv1_1  and tlsv1_2. This option is available with OpenSSL 1.1.0  and later, and should be used instead of disable_ssl_methods/1.\n\nmax_protocol_version(+Atom): Set the maximum protocol version that can be negotiated. Atom is one of sslv3, tlsv1, tlsv1_1  and tlsv1_2. This option is available with OpenSSL 1.1.0  and later, and should be used instead of disable_ssl_methods/1.\n\ndisable_ssl_methods(+List): A list of methods to disable. Unsupported methods will be ignored.  Methods include sslv2, sslv3, sslv23, tlsv1, tlsv1_1 and tlsv1_2. This  option is deprecated starting with OpenSSL 1.1.0. Use min_protocol_version/1  and max_protocol_version/1 instead.\n\nssl_method(+Method): Specify the explicit Method to use when negotiating. For  allowed values, see the list for disable_ssl_methods above.  Using this option is discouraged. When using OpenSSL 1.1.0 or later,  this option is ignored, and a version-flexible method is used to  negotiate the connection. Using version-specific methods is deprecated  in recent OpenSSL versions, and this option will become obsolete and  ignored in the future.\n\nsni_hook(:Goal): This option provides Server Name Indication (SNI) for SSL  servers. This means that depending on the host to which a client  connects, different options (certificates etc.) can be used for the  server. This TLS extension allows you to host different domains using  the same IP address and physical machine. When a TLS connection is  negotiated with a client that has provided a host name via SNI, the hook  is called as follows:  \n\ncall(Goal, +SSL0, +HostName, -SSL)\n\n  Given the current context SSL0, and the host name of the client  request, the predicate computes SSL which is used as the  context for negotiating the connection. The first solution is used. If  the predicate fails, the default options are used, which are those of  the encompassing ssl_context/3  call. In that case, if no default certificate and key are specified, the  client connection is rejected.\n\n  Role is one of server  or client and denotes whether the SSL instance will have a server or client role in the  established connection.

Default depends on the operating system.\n\nnlink(-Count): Number of hard links to the file. This expresses the number of `names'  the file has. Not supported on all operating systems and the value might  be bogus. See the documentation of fstat() for your OS and the value st_nlink.\n\noutput: True if Stream has mode write, append  or update.\n\nposition(Pos): Unify Pos with the current stream position. A stream position  is an opaque term whose fields can be extracted using stream_position_data/3.  See also set_stream_position/2.\n\nreposition(Bool): Unify Bool with true if the position of the stream  can be set (see seek/4).  It is assumed the position can be set if the stream has a seek-function  and is not based on a POSIX file descriptor that is not associated to a  regular file.\n\nrepresentation_errors(Mode): Determines behaviour of character output if the stream cannot represent  a character. For example, an ISO Latin-1 stream cannot represent  Cyrillic characters. The behaviour is one of error (throw  an I/O error exception), prolog (write \\...\\  escape code) or xml (write &#...; XML  character entity). The initial mode is prolog for the user  streams and error for all other streams. See also section  2.18.1 and set_stream/2.\n\ntimeout(-Time): Time is the timeout currently associated with the stream. See set_stream/2  with the same option. If no timeout is specified, Time is unified to the atom infinite.\n\ntype(Type): Unify Type with text or binary.\n\ntty(Bool): This property is reported with Bool equal to true  if the stream is associated with a terminal.

If the thread is created  successfully, the thread identifier of the created thread is unified to Id.  Id is the alias name if the option alias(name)  is given. Otherwise it is a blob of type thread.  The anonymous blobs are subject to atom garbage collection. If a thread  handle is garbage collected and the thread is not detached, it  is joined if it has already terminated (see thread_join/2)  and detached otherwise (see thread_detach/1).149Up  to version 7.3.23, anonymous thread handles were integers. Using  integers did not allow for safe checking of the thread's status as the  thread may have died and the handle may have been reused and did not  allow for garbage collection to take care of forgotten threads.  The thread identifier blobs are printed as <thread>(I,Ptr),  where I is the internal thread identifier and Ptr  is the unique address of the identifier. The I is accepted as  input argument for all thread APIs that accept a thread identifier for  convenient interaction from the toplevel. See also thread_property/2. \n\nOptions is a list of options. The currently defined  options are below. Stack size options can also take the value inf  or infinite, which is mapped to the maximum stack size  supported by the platform. \n\nalias(AliasName): Associate an `alias name' with the thread. This name may be used to  refer to the thread and remains valid until the thread is joined (see thread_join/2).\n\nat_exit(:AtExit): Register AtExit as using thread_at_exit/1  before entering the thread goal.

If false (default true), the new thread is created with the property debug(false) and debugging is disabled before the new  thread is started. The thread debugging predicates such as tspy/1  and tdebug/0  do not signal threads with the debug property set to false.150Currently,  the flag is only used as a hint for the the various debugging  primitives, i.e., the system does not really enforce that the target  thread stays in nodebug mode.\n\ndetached(Bool): If false (default), the thread can be waited for using thread_join/2. thread_join/2  must be called on this thread to reclaim all resources associated with  the thread. If true, the system will reclaim all associated  resources automatically after the thread finishes. Please note that  thread identifiers are freed for reuse after a detached thread finishes  or a normal thread has been joined. See also thread_join/2  and thread_detach/1.  If a detached thread dies due to failure or exception of the initial  goal, the thread prints a message using print_message/2.  If such termination is considered normal, the code must be wrapped using ignore/1  and/or catch/3  to ensure successful completion.\n\ninherit_from(+ThreadId): Inherit defaults from the given ThreadId instead of the  calling thread. This option was added to ensure that the __thread_pool_manager (see thread_create_in_pool/4),  which is created lazily, has a predictable state. The following  properties are inherited:  The prompt (see prompt/2)\nThe typein module (see module/1)\nThe standard streams (user_input, etc.)\nThe default encoding (see encoding)\nThe default locale (see setlocale/1)\nAll prolog flags\nThe limits of Prolog stacks (see set_prolog_stack/2)\n\n\n\nglobal(K-Bytes): Set the limit to which the global stack of this thread may grow.

This is still accepted as a synonym.\n\ntrail(K-Bytes): Set the limit to which the trail stack of this thread may grow. If  omitted, the limit of the calling thread is used. See also the -T command line option.\n\n  The Goal argument is copied to the new Prolog  engine.

The advantage is that we can start the debugger at the first  possible location while preserving the entire exception context if there  is no matching catch/3  goal.

It also registers/unregisters it in the topology server name table. This  makes the address visible/invisible to the rest of the network according  to the scope specified in ScopingOption. ScopingOption  is a grounded term that is one of:  scope(Scope): where Scope is one of: zone, cluster, or node. Servers may bind to more than one address by making  successive calls to tipc_bind/3,  one for each address that it wishes to advertise. The server will  receive traffic for all of them. A server may, for example, register one  address with node scope, another with cluster scope, and a third with  zone scope. A client may then limit the scope of its transmission by  specifying the appropriate address.\n\nno_scope(Scope): where Scope is as defined above. An application may target a specific  address for removal from its collection of addresses by specifying the  address and its scope. The scoping option, no_scope(all),  may be used to unbind the socket from all of its registered addresses.  This feature allows an application to gracefully exit from service.  Because the socket remains open, the application may continue to service  current transactions to completion. TIPC however, will not schedule any  new work for the server instance. If no other servers are available, the  work will be rejected or dropped according to the socket options  specified by the client.\n\n  Connection-oriented, byte-stream services are implemented with this  predicate combined with tipc_listen/2  and tipc_accept/3.  Connectionless, datagram services may be implemented using tipc_receive/4. \n\nNote that clients do not need to bind to any address. Its port-id is  sufficient for this role.

The library supports two encryption formats: traditional Unix  DES-hashes2On non-Unix systems,  crypt() is provided by the NetBSD library. The license header is added  at the end of this document. and FreeBSD compatible MD5  hashes (all platforms). MD5 hashes start with the magic sequence $1$,  followed by an up to 8 character salt. DES hashes start with a  2 character salt. Note that a DES hash considers only the first 8  characters. The MD5 considers the whole string. \n\nSalt and algorithm can be forced by instantiating the start of Encrypted with it.

As with any MAC, it may be  used to simultaneously verify both the data integrity and the  authenticity of a message. Any iterative cryptographic hash function,  such as MD5 or SHA-1, may be used in the calculation of an HMAC; the  resulting MAC algorithm is termed HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA-1 accordingly.  The cryptographic strength of the HMAC depends upon the cryptographic  strength of the underlying hash function, on the size and quality of the  key and the size of the hash output length in bits.''

TimeOut may be  specified as a floating point number to specify fractions of a second.  If TimeOut equals infinite, wait_for_input/3  waits indefinitely. If Timeout is 0 or 0.0 this predicate  returns without waiting.85Prior to  7.3.23, the integer value `0' was the same as infinite.  This predicate can be used to implement timeout while reading and to  handle input from multiple sources and is typically used to wait for  multiple (network) sockets. On Unix systems it may be used on any stream  that is associated with a system file descriptor. On Windows it can only  be used on sockets. If ListOfStreams contains a stream that  is not associated with a supported device, a domain_error(waitable_stream,  Stream) is raised. \n\nThe example below waits for input from the user and an explicitly  opened secondary terminal stream. On return, Inputs may hold user_input or P4 or both. \n\n\n\n?- open('/dev/ttyp4', read, P4),\n   wait_for_input([user_input, P4], Inputs, 0).\n\n  When  available, the implementation is based on the poll() system call. The  poll() puts no additional restriction on the number of open files the  process may have. It does limit the time to 2^31-1  milliseconds (a bit less than 25 days). Specifying a too large timeout  raises a representation_error(timeout) exception. If poll() is not  supported by the OS, select() is used. The select() call can only handle  file descriptors up to FD_SETSIZE. If the set contains a  descriptor that exceeds this limit a representation_error('FD_SETSIZE') is raised. \n\nNote that wait_for_input/3  returns streams that have data waiting. This does not mean you can, for  example, call read/2  on the stream without blocking as the stream might hold an incomplete  term. The predicate set_stream/2  using the option timeout(Seconds) can be used to make the  stream generate an exception if no new data arrives within the timeout  period. Suppose two processes communicate by exchanging Prolog terms.

    "description":"[ISO]write_term(+Term, +Options).\nThe predicate write_term/2  is the generic form of all Prolog term-write predicates. Valid options  are:  attributes(Atom): Define how attributed variables (see section  7.1) are written. The default is determined by the Prolog flag write_attributes.  Defined values are ignore (ignore the attribute), dots  (write the attributes as {...}), write (simply  hand the attributes recursively to write_term/2)  and portray (hand the attributes to attr_portray_hook/2).\n\nback_quotes(Atom): Fulfills the same role as the back_quotes  prolog flag. Notably, the value string causes string  objects to be printed between back quotes and symbol_char  causes the backquote to be printed unquoted. In all other cases the  backquote is printed as a quoted atom.\n\nbrace_terms(Bool): If true (default), write {}(X) as {X}.  See also dotlists and ignore_ops.\n\nblobs(Atom): Define how non-text blobs are handled. By default, this is left to the  write handler specified with the blob type. Using portray, portray/1  is called for each blob encountered. See section  11.4.7.\n\ncharacter_escapes(Bool): If true and quoted(true) is active, special  characters in quoted atoms and strings are emitted as ISO escape  sequences. Default is taken from the reference module (see below).\n\ncycles(Bool): If true (default), cyclic terms are written as @(Template, Substitutions), where Substitutions  is a list Var = Value. If cycles is false, max_depth is not given, and Term is cyclic, write_term/2  raises a domain_error.86The  cycles option and the cyclic term representation using the @-term are  copied from SICStus Prolog. However, the default in SICStus is set to false  and SICStus writes an infinite term if not protected by, e.g., the depth_limit  option. See also the cycles option in read_term/2.\n\ndotlists(Bool): If true (default false), write lists using the  dotted term notation rather than the list notation.87Copied  from ECLiPSe. Note that as of version 7, the list  constructor is '[|]'. Using dotlists(true), write_term/2  writes a list using `.' as constructor. This is intended for  communication with programs such as other Prolog systems, that rely on  this notation.\n\nfullstop(Bool): If true (default false), add a fullstop token  to the output. The dot is preceeded by a space if needed and followed by  a space (default) or newline if the nl(true) option is also  given.88Compatible with http://eclipseclp.org/doc/bips/kernel/ioterm/write_term-3.htmlECLiPSe\n\nignore_ops(Bool): If true, the generic term representation (<functor>(<args>  ... )) will be used for all terms. Otherwise (default), operators will  be used where appropriate.89In  traditional systems this flag also stops the syntactic sugar notation  for lists and brace terms. In SWI-Prolog, these are controlled by the  separate options dotlists and brace_terms.\n\nmax_depth(Integer): If the term is nested deeper than Integer, print the  remainder as ellipses ( ... ). A 0 (zero) value (default) imposes no  depth limit. This option also delimits the number of printed items in a  list. Example:  \n\n?- write_term(a(s(s(s(s(0)))), [a,b,c,d,e,f]),\n              [max_depth(3)]).\na(s(s(...)), [a, b|...])\ntrue.\n\n  Used by the top level and debugger to limit screen output. See also  the Prolog flags answer_write_options  and debugger_write_options.\n\nmodule(Module): Define the reference module (default user). This defines  the default value for the character_escapes  option as well as the operator definitions to use. See also op/3.\n\nnl(Bool): Add a newline to the output. See also the fullstop option.\n\nnumbervars(Bool): If true, terms of the format $VAR(N), where N  is a non-negative integer, will be written as a variable name. If N  is an atom it is written without quotes. This extension allows for  writing variables with user-provided names. The default is false.  See also numbervars/3  and the option variable_names.\n\npartial(Bool): If true (default false), do not reset the  logic that inserts extra spaces that separate tokens where needed. This  is intended to solve the problems with the code below. Calling write_value(.)  writes .., which cannot be read. By adding partial(true)  to the option list, it correctly emits . .. Similar  problems appear when emitting operators using multiple calls to write_term/3.  \n\nwrite_value(Value) :-\n        write_term(Value, [partial(true)]),\n        write('.'), nl.\n\n \n\nportray(Bool): Same as portrayed(Bool). Deprecated.\n\nportray_goal(:Goal): Implies portray(true), but calls Goal rather  than the predefined hook portray/1. Goal  is called through call/3,  where the first argument is Goal, the second is the term to  be printed and the 3rd argument is the current write option list. The  write option list is copied from the write_term call, but the list is  guaranteed to hold an option priority that reflects the  current priority.\n\nportrayed(Bool): If true, the hook portray/1  is called before printing a term that is not a variable. If portray/1  succeeds, the term is considered printed. See also print/1.  The default is false. This option is an extension to the  ISO write_term options.\n\npriority(Integer): An integer between 0 and 1200 representing the `context priority'.  Default is 1200. Can be used to write partial terms appearing as the  argument to an operator. For example:  \n\n        format('~w = ', [VarName]),\n        write_term(Value, [quoted(true), priority(699)])\n\n \n\nquoted(Bool): If true, atoms and functors that need quotes will be  quoted. The default is false.\n\nspacing(+Spacing): Determines whether and where extra white space is added to enhance  readability. The default is standard, adding only space  where needed for proper tokenization by read_term/3.  Currently, the only other value is next_argument, adding a  space after a comma used to separate arguments in a term or list.\n\nvariable_names(+List): Assign names to variables in Term. List is a list  of terms Name = Var, where Name is an atom that  represents a valid Prolog variable name. Terms where Var is  bound or is a variable that does not appear in Term are  ignored. Raises an error if List is not a list, one of the  members is not a term Name = Var, Name is not an atom or Name does not represent a valid Prolog variable name.  The implementation binds the variables from List to a term '$VAR'(Name). Like write_canonical/1,  terms that where already bound to '$VAR'(X)  before write_term/2  are printed normally, unless the option numbervars(true) is  also provided. If the option numbervars(true) is used, the  user is responsible for avoiding collisions between assigned names and  numbered names. See also the variable_names option of read_term/2. Possible variable attributes (see section  7.1) are ignored. In most cases one should use copy_term/3  to obtain a copy that is free of attributed variables and handle the  associated constraints as appropriate for the use-case.\n\n ",

For example, last-1 is the element directly preceding the last one.IntExprTrue for the element whose index equals IntExpr. \n\nInteger: The N-th element with the given name, with 1 denoting the first element.  Same as index(Integer).\n\nlast: The last element with the given name. Same as index(last).\n\nlast - IntExpr: The IntExpr-th element before the last. Same as index(last-IntExpr).\n\n  Defined function argument values are: \n\nself: Evaluate to the entire element\n\ncontent: Evaluate to the content of the element (a list)\n\ntext: Evaluates to all text from the sub-tree as an atom\n\nnormalize_space: As text, but uses normalize_space/2  to normalise white-space in the output\n\nnumber: Extract an integer or float from the value. Ignores leading and trailing  white-space\n\n@Attribute: Evaluates to the value of the given attribute. Attribute can be a  compound term. In this case the functor name denotes the element and  arguments perform transformations on the attribute value. Defined  transformations are:  numberTranslate the value into a number using xsd_number_string/2 from library(sgml).integerAs number, but subsequently transform the value into an  integer using the round/1 function.floatAs number, but subsequently transform the value into a  float using the float/1 function.stringTranslate the value into a Prolog string.lowerTranslate the value to lower case, preserving the type.upperTranslate the value to upper case, preserving the type. \n\n  In addition, the argument-list can be conditions: \n\nLeft = Right: Succeeds if the left-hand unifies with the right-hand. If the left-hand  side is a function, this is evaluated. The right-hand side is never  evaluated, and thus the condition content = content defines  that the content of the element is the atom content. The  functions lower_case and upper_case can be  applied to Right (see example below).\n\ncontains(Haystack, Needle): Succeeds if Needle is a sub-string of Haystack.\n\nXPath: Succeeds if XPath matches in the currently selected sub-DOM.  For example, the following expression finds an h3 element  inside a div element, where the div element  itself contains an h2 child with a strong  child.  \n\n//div(h2/strong)/h3\n\n  This is equivalent to the conjunction of XPath goals below. \n\n   ...,\n   xpath(DOM, //(div), Div),\n   xpath(Div, h2/strong, _),\n   xpath(Div, h3, Result)\n\n  \n\n  Examples: \n\nMatch each table-row in DOM: \n\n\n\nxpath(DOM, //tr, TR)\n\n  Match the last cell of each tablerow in DOM. This example  illustrates that a result can be the input of subsequent xpath/3  queries. Using multiple queries on the intermediate TR term guarantee  that all results come from the same table-row: \n\n\n\nxpath(DOM, //tr, TR),\nxpath(TR,  /td(last), TD)\n\n  Match each href attribute in an <a>  element \n\n\n\nxpath(DOM, //a(@href), HREF)\n\n  Suppose we have a table containing rows where each first column is  the name of a product with a link to details and the second is the price  (a number). The following predicate matches the name, URL and price: \n\n\n\nproduct(DOM, Name, URL, Price) :-\n    xpath(DOM, //tr, TR),\n    xpath(TR, td(1), C1),\n    xpath(C1, /self(normalize_space), Name),\n    xpath(C1, a(@href), URL),\n    xpath(TR, td(2, number), Price).\n\n  Suppose we want to select books with genre=\"thriller\" from a tree  containing elements <book genre=...> \n\n\n\nthriller(DOM, Book) :-\n    xpath(DOM, //book(@genre=thiller), Book).\n\n  Match the elements <table align=\"center\"> and <table align=\"CENTER\">: \n\n\n\n    //table(@align(lower) = center)\n\n  Get the width and height of a div  element as a number, and the div node itself: \n\n\n\n    xpath(DOM, //div(@width(number)=W, @height(number)=H), Div)\n\n  Note that div is an infix operator, so parentheses must  be used in cases like the following: \n\n\n\n    xpath(DOM, //(div), Div)\n\n  \n\n",

If an output stream is wrapped, Options define the desired  wrapper and compression level. The new ZStream inherits its encoding from Stream. In other words, if Stream  is a text-stream, so is ZStream. The original Stream  is switched to binary mode while it is wrapped. The original encoding of Stream is restored if ZStream is closed. Note that zopen/3  does not actually process any data and therefore succeeds on input  streams that do not contain valid data. Errors may be generated by read  operations performed on the stream.  Defined options on output streams are: \n\nformat(+Format): Either deflate (default), raw_deflate or gzip.  The deflate envelope is simple and short and is typically  used for compressed (network) communication. The raw_deflate  does not include an envelope and is often used as a step in crypographic  encodings. The gzip envelope is compatible to the gzip  program and intended to read/write compressed files.\n\nlevel(+Level): Number between 0 and 9, specifying the compression level, Higher levels  use more resources. Default is 6, generally believed to be a good  compromise between speed, memory requirement and compression.\n\nmulti_part(+Boolean): If true, restart reading if the input is not at  end-of-file. The default is true for gzip streams.\n\n  Generic options are: \n\nclose_parent(Bool): If true (default), closing the compressed stream also  closes (and thus invalidates) the wrapped stream. If false,  the wrapped stream is not closed. This can be used to  read/write a compressed data block as partial input/output on a stream.\n\n ",
